<title>A Synopsis of the Synopses, 2020&#x02013;2021</title>
<p>With this Synopsis Book, we report on a spectrum of observations and advances that will provide greater understanding of the diagnosis and management of allergic and immunologic disorders impacting children. Reviewers have selected articles that provide clinical &#x0201C;pearls&#x0201D; and insights applicable for daily practice as well as offer data that may lead to new approaches to patient care. In this year&#x02019;s Synopsis, we also include articles covering the rapid dissemination knowledge gained regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as we were globally affected by the challenges of managing a novel pandemic.</p>
<p>Allergic disorders affect a large number of children and anaphylaxis remains a focus of ongoing research efforts. In a retrospective study, the authors describe how the rate of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis have significantly increased in the over the 20-year study (1998&#x02013;2018). Reassuringly, case fatalities rate for food-induced anaphylaxis decreased over that time interval, with peanut and tree nuts noted as the most commonly associated triggers. A sign that anaphylaxis awareness has increased over time is that epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) prescriptions rose by 11&#x00025; on a year-by-year basis. However, the impact of increased number of EAIs in the community on anaphylaxis fatality rates is unknown. Furthermore, obstacles remain to caregiver use of EAIs in the setting of severe reactions. Along with previously identified barriers, such as lack of availability and uncertainty of reaction severity, in 1 study, the authors point out that the emotional impacts of witnessing a child&#x02019;s allergic reactions is a factor to consider.</p>
<p>As part of antibiotic stewardship, delabeling of penicillin allergy for many who incorrectly believe they have such a hypersensitivity continues to be a priority. In 1 retrospective study, the authors noted that direct oral challenge without preceding allergy testing can be safe for those with a low-risk history. In 2 studies, the authors performed economic analyses and provide supporting evidence that penicillin allergy evaluation and delabeling is a cost-effective health care practice.</p>
<p>Several selected studies were focused on treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD). Caregivers often have concerns about the safety of topical corticosteroids (TCS), leading to undertreatment of their child&#x02019;s AD. In one study, the authors note that primary care providers also perceive they maybe be underprescribing TCS for young children, highlighting the need to address TCS hesitancy for both caregivers and health care providers. In a study of crisaborole, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, the authors add to existing data supporting its efficacy in mild-to-moderate AD. As nonsteroidal topical agent, crisaborale may be a preferred treatment option for some, especially for those with TCS hesitancy as a potential barrier to care. Although a biological is already Food and Drug Administration approved for AD, development of novel treatments continues. Data from a phase 3 study of nemolizumab (antiinterleukin-31 receptor A monoclonal antibody) in adults and adolescents revealed clinical efficacy in reducing pruritus. Different biologics have been designed to target different drivers of AD; interleukin-31 plays a role in inducing pruritus, so this was the primary outcome of this study.</p>
<p>Our reviewers also highlighted multiple studies pertaining to food allergy. Although guidelines for early introduction of peanut allergy to high-risk infants were issued in 2017, implementation is essential for recommendations to impact outcomes. Guideline uptake was examined in a survey study of US allergists. Although guideline awareness was high among participants, concerns about allergic reactions and food challenges as well as reimbursement and liability were identified as barriers. Other potential risk factors for peanut allergy were also investigated. Results from one study support that family history does not predispose a child to peanut allergy, and it is suggested that earlier introduction within the first year of life appears to be more favorable. In other studies, it is suggested that overall increased diversity of the infant diet (introducing more foods in the first year) appears favorable for allergy prevention.</p>
<p>Proper management of food allergies requires an understanding of real versus perceived risks for reactions. Results of a retrospective study of airborne challenges to peanut provide reassuring support that this route of exposure is unlikely to trigger significant reactions. A study of food precautionary allergen labeling reinforces that counseling on reading food labels is a key part of patient education and that advocacy to improve labeling requirements may ease the burden on caregivers. As shown in a population-based cohort study of children aged 6 years with food allergy, allergic reactions are common. Thus, education on recognition of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis remains an integral facet of food allergy management. Identifying that anaphylaxis is occurring can be difficult for caregivers, which can contribute to the underuse of epinephrine autoinjectors for severe reactions. In recent years, oral immunotherapy for food allergy has been the focus of significant research attention. In 2 real-world studies, researchers add further safety and efficacy data and show positive impact on quality of life. Epicutaneous immunotherapy is also in phase 3 trials, and a recently published study reveals that this approach to treatment can be associated with improved quality of life for families living with food allergy.</p>
<p>Non-IgE&#x02013;mediated food allergies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract. These include food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis, which are the focus of several reviews in this Synopsis Book. Data from 2 prospective cohort studies suggest that more diagnostic guidance may be beneficial to identify infants with FPIAP. Furthermore, resolution occurs sooner than 1 year of age for many, and reintroduction may be indicated earlier in life, which could mitigate the twofold increased risk for immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated allergy reported for young children with FPIAP. Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome is another disorder that requires awareness, and, as one survey-based study reveals, foods less typically seen for immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated allergies (such as oat, rice, sweet potato, and avocado) are often implicated. Similarly, eosinophilic esophagitis can manifest in infants, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and treatment.</p>
<p>Our reviewers selected a large number of studies related to asthma, with many focused on risk factors. In several reviews, the authors examined the impact of early-life exposures, including environmental exposures (smoking and pollution) and the microbiome as well as effects of mitigation measures. In a few studies, the authors also highlight the long-term impacts of early-life exposures, with effects on lung function evident well into adulthood.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve asthma management are multifaceted. A multicenter national study reveals that implementation of evidence-based clinical pathways for asthma in the emergency department setting can improve quality of care for asthma. Strong partnerships outside the physician office can also support management because studies reveal the benefits of school-based management and community health workers conducting home visits. Novel approaches to support remote monitoring of medication use are also explored. Electronic monitoring of inhaler use may have positive effects of adherence and, thus, asthma control, but further studies will be needed to determine the feasibility of wider use of this type of intervention and its impacts on health care costs and use.</p>
<p>Oral corticosteroids are standardly used to treat acute wheezing episodes. In a study, researchers found that, in preschool-aged children presenting with acute wheezing to the emergency department, oral prednisolone may provide short-term benefits, but additional doses do not appear to alter respiratory outcomes at 24 hours or beyond. In contrast, another study reminds us that potential adverse effects (such as gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis, and pneumonia) of oral steroids must be considered when prescribing multiday bursts for children with asthma. Several biologics are now available for pediatric asthma, and 2 studies reveal that omalizumab and mepolizumab, both approved for &#x02265;6 years, are effective in the real-world clinical setting, and home infusions can be done safely in select patients.</p>
<p>The immunology section is expanded this year, owing to articles covering COVID-19. Several reviews chronicle the evolving understanding of the immune response against COVID-19 as well as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is seen in children. In selected articles on primary immunodeficiency, the authors highlight the success of the newborn screening program in identifying infants with SCID and other severe T-cell immunodeficiencies and that early identification and intervention have resulted in improved clinical outcomes for these vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>On behalf our reviewers, we hope that this Supplement provides you practical information to improve the clinical care of children with allergic and immunologic diseases.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Early-life exposures to heavy metals have been associated with many adverse health outcomes in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of fetal exposure to lead, cadmium, and manganese with the risk of developing asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and food allergy in early childhood.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 651 children who were part of a longitudinal birth cohort living in France.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A total of 2002 mothers were recruited for the birth cohort in early pregnancy. They underwent an initial clinical examination and survey assessing their lifestyle and health between 24 and 28 weeks&#x00027; gestation. Pregnancy, birth, and newborn characteristics were collected through standardized questionnaires and obstetric records. Measurements of lead, cadmium, and manganese were performed from the first consecutive 915 mother&#x02013;children pairs from peripheral blood samples of mothers between 24 and 28 weeks&#x00027; gestation as well as from cord blood at the time of delivery. A standardized parental-administered questionnaire used to assess the child&#x02019;s health and environment was administered every 4 months for the first year, followed by every year until the age of 5 years and then, finally, at the age of 8 years. Asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and food allergy were defined as positive responses for corresponding questions by using the International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 915 children were enrolled for laboratory assessment of heavy metal exposure, and 845 completed this. Of these, 651 children had follow-up between 3 and 8 years of age and were included in this study. A total of 60&#x00025; completed the final assessment at 8 years, and 52&#x00025; were male. In this group, there was a lifetime prevalence of 17&#x00025; for asthma, 22&#x00025; for allergic rhinitis, 43&#x00025; for eczema, and 11&#x00025; for food allergy. There was a weak correlation between the concentrations of metals measured in maternal midpregnancy and cord blood samples. Comparing the quartiles of subjects with the lowest and highest exposure, there was a significant association between cord blood cadmium and food allergy &#x00028;hazard ratio &#x00028;HR&#x00029;: 3.17 [1.36&#x02013;7.38]&#x00029;, cord blood cadmium and eczema &#x00028;HR: 1.60 [1.09&#x02013;2.35]&#x00029;, and maternal blood manganese and eczema &#x00028;HR: 1.55 [1.05&#x02013;2.28]&#x00029;, adjusted for sex, BMI, maternal education, parental history of atopy, maternal smoking in pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age, and type of delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In a prospective birth cohort, there was an association between fetal exposure to cadmium and manganese and the development of eczema and food allergy by 8 years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This may be the first prospective study in which researchers suggest an association between in utero exposure to heavy metals and risk for developing atopic diseases, although limited by parental report of these conditions. Further studies are needed to not only confirm this association but, also, to evaluate the effect of timing of in utero heavy metal exposure on the risk of developing atopic diseases in childhood, given the weak correlation between heavy metal concentrations in maternal midpregnancy and cord blood samples.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843B">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843B</ext-link></p></sec></body></sub-article>

It has been hypothesized that cesarean delivery may disrupt maternal&#x02013;infant microbial transfer, thereby affecting immune system development and increasing the risk of atopic dermatitis in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Mothers who had a singleton live birth at a Kaiser Permanente North California or contracting hospital between January 1, 2005, to January 1, 2014 and whose child had continuous enrollment in the Kaiser Permanente North California system for at least 4 years were included in the study &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 173&#x02009;105&#x00029;. Among this birth cohort, a subsample of births &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 102&#x02009;327&#x00029; occurring mostly after 2008 because of the adoption of electronic health records included more detailed information of cesarean delivery conditions &#x00028;start of labor, timing of membrane rupture, and cesarean delivery indication&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this observational study, the researchers collected maternal and child information using these data sources: electronic health record, pharmacy databases, state birth records, and a prospectively collected survey regarding breastfeeding behavior at 2 months of age. The authors used modified Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation to assess the association between cesarean delivery and atopic dermatitis overall and when stratified by demographic and labor and delivery characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There were 173&#x02009;105 children born to 135&#x02009;102 mothers during the study time period. A total of 12&#x00025; of the children &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 20&#x02009;819&#x00029; met the case definition for AD, and 26.6&#x00025; of the births were born via cesarean delivery. The prevalence of AD was higher among children who were male, born term, were first born and did not have an NICU admission. Mothers of children with AD were more likely to be people of color &#x00028;African-American, Asian, or Pacific Islander&#x00029; and have underweight prepregnancy BMI. The prevalence of cesarean delivery was higher among mothers who were older, had higher levels of education, had a higher prepregnancy BMI, and were African American race. Infants born by cesarean delivery were more likely to be born at an earlier gestational age, had a high or low birth weight, were in the NICU, and were first born. In the primary multivariate model controlling for all covariates, there was little evidence that children born via cesarean delivery were more likely to develop AD by age 4, compared with children born vaginally &#x00028;risk ratio [RR]: 1.02; confidence interval [CI]: 0.99 to 1.05&#x00029;. Among all stratified models &#x00028;AD diagnosis before or after 6 months, maternal atopy, gestational age, birth order, prepregnancy BMI, and child&#x02019;s sex&#x00029;, the RR for cesarean delivery and AD was minimal. Cesarean delivery conditions indicative of the least exposure to maternal microbiome &#x00028;ie, no labor and short interval between membrane rupture and delivery&#x00029; revealed no evidence of association with AD. In addition, intrapartum antibiotics, breastfeeding, or familial factors did not strongly influence an association. Only term infants born via cesarean delivery because of a breech or other malpresentation with labor &#x00028;RR: 1.07; CI 0.94 to 1.21&#x00029; or because of failure to progress &#x00028;RR: 1.09; CI: 1.01 to 1.17&#x00029; showed modest evidence of higher risk of AD by the age of 4 years, compared with term infants born vaginally.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Delivery by cesarean delivery was not associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis by the age of 4 years.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The authors point out that this is the largest study-to-date using observational data for a US-based birth cohort regarding mode of delivery and atopic dermatitis development. The results of this study are consistent with previous research findings. The strengths of this study are the large amount of data analyzed and the prospectively collected information on cesarean delivery conditions, intrapartum antibiotic administration, breastfeeding information, and within-family characteristics &#x00028;via a matched sibling analysis&#x00029;.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843C">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843C</ext-link></p></sec></body></sub-article>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if high microbial content in drinking water alters the risk of allergic disease in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged 6 to 16 years living in Eastern Croatia between 2011 and 2013 were recruited for the study. The authors report that this area of Croatia is unique in that individuals have access to drinking water through 2 different supply systems: public mains or individual wells.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>There were 2 phases of the study. In phase 1, parents were asked to complete a survey regarding their child&#x02019;s symptoms, physician-diagnosed illnesses, medication use and type of drinking water supply: public mains and/or individual wells. In phase 2, one-half of the study participant&#x02019;s parents were randomly selected to complete a questionnaire about home location, farming practices, and socioeconomic status. Their children underwent skin-prick testing for 9 aeroallergens: dust mites, cockroach, molds &#x00028;<italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Cladosporium</italic>&#x00029; and pollens &#x00028;birch, hazelnut, grass, and ragweed&#x00029;. Data on the microbial content of drinking water from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed to ascertain information about early-life exposure for the study participants. Water samples were collected at random points from public mains and from each individual well in participating households.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 1110 children were recruited for phase 1 of the study, with 978 children fulfilling study criteria. A total of 51.5&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 504&#x00029; of the children attended urban schools, and 48.5&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 474&#x00029; attended rural schools. A total of 494 children accessed drinking water through the public main water supply, whereas 484 accessed it through individual wells. More than 90&#x00025; of the 484 children with individual wells attended rural schools. There were only 21 children living in urban areas who accessed individual well water. There was a significant difference in the cumulative bacterial load in drinking water, with samples from individual wells having a much higher bacterial load: individual wells &#x00028;6390 colony forming units per mL [4190&#x02013;9550]&#x00029; versus public &#x00028;0 colony forming units per mL [0&#x02013;0]&#x00029;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001. Children who had access to individual wells had significantly lower rates of lifetime prevalence of asthma &#x00028;2.3&#x00025; vs 5.5&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> = .011&#x00029;, atopic dermatitis &#x00028;6.7&#x00025; vs 14.4&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and rhinitis &#x00028;15.1&#x00025; vs 25.2&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, compared with that of those children who had access to a public main water supply.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Exposure to high microbial content in drinking water may confer protection against allergic disease development in childhood.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Here is one more study that lends further support to the hygiene hypothesis revealing that high microbial exposures in drinking water may protect children against the development of atopic diseases. The authors also add another possible route of exposure to explain the lower prevalence of allergic disease found in those living in rural environments.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843D">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843D</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To identify first year of life feeding cohorts and examine associations between respiratory health and allergy at 8 years of age and infant feeding practices.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 3446 infants born in Paris, France, were managed from birth to 8 years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Questionnaires were collected at 1,3,6,9, and 12 months of life, focusing on breastfeeding, consumption of infant formula &#x00028;regular, partially hydrolyzed, extensively hydrolyzed, prebiotics and probiotics, and soy&#x00029;, and solid food introduction. Multidimensional longitudinal cluster analysis was used to place children with similar early feeding practices into 5 cohorts. Standardized questionnaires, physician documentation, lung function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and specific immunoglobulin E were collected at 8 years of life. These data were used to identify atopic morbidity correlations between feeding cohorts. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusted for early respiratory and allergic outcomes and parental history of allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Participants were grouped into 5 feeding clusters on the basis of early feeding patterns: cluster 1 &#x00028;45&#x00025;&#x00029;: mostly regular formula; cluster 2 &#x00028;27&#x00025;&#x00029;: exclusively breastfed during the first 3 months; cluster 3: &#x00028;17&#x00025;&#x00029; prebiotic or probiotic formula; cluster 4: &#x00028;7&#x00025;&#x00029; partially hydrolyzed formula, and cluster 5: &#x00028;4&#x00025;&#x00029; extensively hydrolyzed or soy formula. Compared with infants in cluster 1, children fed extensively hydrolyzed or soy formula were more likely to have diagnosis of food allergy &#x00028;cluster 5&#x00029;. Infants fed partially hydrolyzed formula &#x00028;cluster 4&#x00029; had a significant lower lung function &#x00028;forced expiratory volume in 1 second; forced vital capacity&#x00029;, higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and higher risk of allergic sensitization at 8 years of life, compared with that of cluster 1. Compared with infants fed mostly regular formula &#x00028;cluster 1&#x00029;, infants exclusively breastfed during the first 3 months &#x00028;cluster 2&#x00029; had a lower rate of asthma diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Children breastfeeding at least 3 months in this study had protection against developing asthma and food allergy later in life, compared with other feeding groups. Infants with early partially hydrolyzed formula had higher rates of asthma and atopy at 8 years of age, even while controlling for early respiratory or allergic disease and family history of atopy.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This supports previous recommendations regarding breastfeeding and the prevention of atopic conditions. The authors caution pediatricians against recommending hydrolyzed or hypoallergenic formulas universally or on the basis of family history alone and highlight potential future morbidity. This study revealed no benefits in preventing atopic disease with prebiotic or probiotic formulas, although the grouping of multiple different types of these formulas in 1 heterogenous group is a significant study limitation. The mechanisms underlying these results deserve further study.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843E">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843E</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>The authors described the spectrum of disease seen in patients admitted with electronic cigarette or vaping product-use&#x02013;associated lung injury &#x00028;EVALI&#x00029;. This is the first focused case series of EVALI in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>All patients aged 13 to 18 years admitted to the authors&#x02019; tertiary care, university-affiliated children&#x02019;s hospital &#x00028;Dallas, TX&#x00029; with a diagnosis of EVALI.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective chart review of patients admitted with EVALI from December 2018 to November 2019.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 13 patients were admitted with EVALI. Patients endorsed usage of &#x003B4;-9-tetrahydrocannabinol &#x00028;THC&#x00029; &#x00028;12&#x00029;, nicotine and THC &#x00028;7&#x00029;, and nicotine &#x00028;1&#x00029;. Symptoms included subjective fever &#x00028;100&#x00025;&#x00029;, respiratory symptoms &#x00028;85&#x00025;&#x00029;, and GI symptoms &#x00028;85&#x00025;&#x00029;. A total of 23&#x00025; of abnormal lung CTs were identified on abdominal computed tomography scans in patients undergoing a primary gastrointestinal evaluation. Respiratory support included room air &#x00028;1&#x00029;, nasal cannula &#x00028;8&#x00029;, bilevel positive airway pressure &#x00028;2&#x00029;, intubation &#x00028;1&#x00029;, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation &#x00028;1&#x00029;. Four patients required supplemental oxygen at discharge. Five patients had pulmonary function tests pre- and postglucocorticoid administration. forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity both increased significantly after glucocorticoids.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The clinical severity of EVALI in adolescents is variable. The majority of admitted patients required some form of oxygenation support. Glucocorticoids were a successful treatment with objective improvement in pulmonary function tests &#x00028;postglucocorticoid administration.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This is an important case series for pediatricians to learn from, regarding EVALI. As we learn more about this potentially fatal condition, common threads have emerged that are supported by these findings, including the use of vaping products for THC and various alterations to the vaping device. It is important for pediatricians and all health care professionals who work with adolescents to recognize the dangers associated with vaping and e-cigarette use as well as learn skills to communicate these risks with individual patients. Although federal and state regulations have been enacted to try and limit the use of these products in children and adolescents, millions remain vulnerable.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843F">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843F</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To analyze trends in hospital admissions for food anaphylaxis in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2018, including case-fatality rates.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>All patients admitted to hospitals for anaphylaxis in the United Kingdom &#x00028;England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland&#x00029; were studied. Children were identified as age &#x02264;15 years.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p><italic>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</italic>, codes were analyzed for all allergy-related admissions with both food-related and non&#x02013;food-related causes, by using the Hospital Episodes Statistics database via the National Health Services. Fatal food-induced anaphylaxis data has been recorded through the UK&#x02019;s Fatal Anaphylaxis Registry. Admission data were compared along time trends among different age groups, sex, and inciting triggers. Trends in the national case-fatality rate and epinephrine autoinjector &#x00028;EAI&#x00029; prescriptions were also analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Across all age groups, allergy-related hospital admissions increased during the study period from 10 to 28 admissions per 100c000 population per year, at a rate ratio of 1.043 &#x00028;1.042 to 1.043; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. A total of 255c913 admissions occurred during the 10-year interval, of which 39.8&#x00025; were due to anaphylaxis. The rate of anaphylaxis-associated admissions increased by 179&#x00025;, with a rate ratio of 1.047 &#x00028;1.046 to 1.048; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; and was similar across all age groups. Girls had a higher rate of admission for nonfood anaphylaxis admissions. Boys &#x00028;age: &lt;15&#x00029; had a higher rate of admission with food triggers, but this predominance dissipated into adulthood. A total of 30.1&#x00025; of admissions for anaphylaxis were identified with a food trigger, with an annual rate ratio of 1.057 &#x00028;1.055 to 1.059; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. The greatest increase was observed in children, from 2.1 to 9.2 admissions per 100c000 or an increase of 339&#x00025;. Individuals aged 15 to 59 years had an increase of 214&#x00025;, whereas those aged &gt;60 years had an increase of 78&#x00025; over the same time interval. Despite a national recommendation in 2016 encouraging admission for children with suspected anaphylaxis, the admission rate for children did not significantly increase. The annual fatality rates from food-induced anaphylaxis were 0.009 and 0.008 per 100c000 population in 1998 and 2018, respectively, but the case-fatality rate had decreased from 0.70&#x00025; to 0.19&#x00025; in the same period. The highest rate of fatalities occurred in teenagers. Children &lt;5 years of age were more likely to be admitted for anaphylaxis but had lower rates of death. A total of 46&#x00025; of fatalities were associated with peanuts or tree nuts. Additionally, the fatality rate associated with cow&#x02019;s milk increased since 1992, with 26&#x00025; of deaths in children and 5&#x00025; in adults caused by cow&#x02019;s milk exposure. The rates of death from peanuts and tree nuts decreased during this interval. Prescriptions for EAI devices increased by 336&#x00025; overall or by an 11&#x00025; increase on a year-by-year basis.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>From 1998&#x02013;2018, the number of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis and prescriptions for EAIs in the United Kingdom significantly increased, and the case-fatality rate for anaphylaxis decreased. Peanuts and tree nuts accounted for the greatest portion of fatal reactions, but among children &lt;5 years of age, cow&#x02019;s milk was the most common trigger.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The strengths of this study include the use of 20 years of data and a national database that examined &gt;255c000 admissions. This study also revealed the increasing role of cow&#x02019;s milk anaphylaxis in food allergy fatalities. This study relied on <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</italic>, codes. It is possible that the data regarding admissions and fatalities are an underestimate because anaphylaxis and its triggers are often not coded accurately.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843G">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843G</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To understand factors that would help identify patients who are at an increased risk of developing severe anaphylaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, the researchers included 453 emergency department &#x00028;ED&#x00029; visits identified with anaphylaxis in a 2-year time period &#x00028;May 2016 to April 2018&#x00029; in 7 pediatric EDs in Spain.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a prospective multicenter study in 7 pediatric EDs in which researchers had ED staff recruit patients to participate at the time of anaphylaxis diagnosis. The ED provider completed a data questionnaire at the time of discharge from the hospital or admission to the hospital. The questionnaire and the treatment of each patient were then reviewed, with a significant focus on the 61 visits of patients diagnosed with severe anaphylaxis that met &#x02265;1 of the following criteria: &#x02265;2 doses of epinephrine, clinically important biphasic reaction, endotracheal intubation, intensive care admission, and/or death.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>With the use of multivariable regression, 5 independent risk factors were found for severe anaphylaxis including &#x00028;1&#x00029; a history of asthma, &#x00028;2&#x00029; an onset of symptoms &lt;5 minutes after allergen exposure, &#x00028;3&#x00029; a nonwell appearance, &#x00028;4&#x00029; tachycardia, and &#x00028;5&#x00029; hypotension. Furthermore, the risk of severe anaphylaxis increased with each additional risk factor.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this study, the researchers identified 5 factors that increased the risk of severe anaphylaxis. These should be considered in the management of anaphylaxis cases in the ED, such as planning for inpatient observation versus outpatient management.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The significant limitations of this study include that&#x0223C;20&#x00025; of anaphylaxis ED cases were not recruited for the study, and the baseline asthma control was not assessed, thus they were unable to identify if the link between asthma and severe anaphylaxis is more an association with uncontrolled asthma at baseline rather than simply an asthma diagnosis. Regardless of these limitations, the prospective nature of this study out of the ED allowed them to include nearly all patients who come to the ED for anaphylaxis evaluation. This is significant when compared with prospective reviews completed from allergy clinic follow-up as a number patients with anaphylaxis who are treated in the ED do not have proper follow-up. Finally, this study identified factors that may increase the risk of complications from anaphylaxis that would be helpful to consider when deciding between inpatient monitoring versus outpatient management.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843H">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843H</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>In this study, the researchers evaluate barriers to epinephrine autoinjector &#x00028;EA&#x00029; use in the treatment of allergic reactions to food occurring outside of the health care setting.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Participants were recruited from a food allergy clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, New York. Most respondents were mothers &#x00028;76.8&#x00025;&#x00029;, with a 4-year college degree or beyond &#x00028;96.3&#x00025;&#x00029; and an annual household income &gt;&#x00024;150c000 &#x00028;75.6&#x00025;&#x00029;. Most patients were male &#x00028;69.5&#x00025;&#x00029;, with an average age of 7.5 years.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>An anonymous survey was distributed to caregivers during a food allergy clinic visit before allergy education. Patients were required to have a physician-diagnosed food allergy and a previously prescribed EA. Data were then analyzed by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation and Fisher&#x02019;s &#x003C7;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 164 surveys were included in the analysis. All but 1 caregiver-reported previous EA teaching, most of which was done verbally &#x00028;90.9&#x00025;&#x00029;, with printed materials &#x00028;83.5&#x00025;&#x00029; and live demonstrations of EA use &#x00028;81.7&#x00025;&#x00029;. A total of 95.1&#x00025; of EA education was done by an allergy specialist, with only 38.4&#x00025; of reported education by a pediatrician. The majority of caregivers were either &#x0201C;very confident&#x0201D; &#x00028;43.3&#x00025;&#x00029; or &#x0201C;fairly confident&#x0201D; &#x00028;42.1&#x00025;&#x00029; in their ability to use an EA during a severe allergic reaction. On review of reaction history, it was found that 72.0&#x00025; of reactions were severe and warranted EA administration, but only 38.1&#x00025; were treated with epinephrine. Lack of EA use was significantly associated with oral antihistamine administration instead &#x00028;76.7&#x00025; of responses; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, caregiver feeling that symptoms were not severe enough &#x00028;47.9&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> = .016&#x00029;, and caregiver fear or nervousness about the reaction &#x00028;29&#x00025;l <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Although hives &#x00028;84.8&#x00025;&#x00029; was the most commonly reported symptom in a reaction, only vomiting &#x00028;41.5&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, cough &#x00028;33.5&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and shortness of breath &#x00028;31.1&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; were significantly associated with EA use. There was no association with lack of EA use during a severe reaction and level of confidence in EA use or method of education.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Despite high levels of caregiver confidence in the ability to administer epinephrine, EAs are often underused during severe reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>There are many barriers to appropriate EA use, even in the setting of a well-educated and previously trained population. Repeated EA teaching focused on symptom recognition, indications for EA use, and emotional preparedness may benefit caregivers of patients with food allergies.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843I">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843I</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess the potential laceration risk epinephrine autoinjectors &#x00028;AAIs&#x00029; by using 2 methods, swing and jab &#x00028;S&amp;J&#x00029; and the place and press &#x00028;P&amp;P&#x00029;, given the published concerns over laceration injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study in Cardiff, England, researchers examined the different methods of AAI use in 100 children &#x00028;5&#x02013;11 years old; mean: 8 years&#x00029; without previous knowledge of autoinjector use.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Face paint was placed in the center of the EpiPen trainer device, in which the needle would be in a real AAI, and all excess paint around the &#x0201C;needle&#x0201D; indentation was removed. Both methods S&amp;J and P&amp;P&#x00029; of administration were used on each child&#x02019;s lateral outer bare thigh sequentially, with the first method alternating between each child. When the trainer pen clicked, the child was asked to pretend they felt a pinch or sting and move their leg accordingly. Whether the child moved for each method was recorded. The length of each painted mark was measured in millimeters to assess the risk of laceration.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 50&#x00025; did not move when the EpiPen was administered; 32&#x00025; moved for both methods, and 18&#x00025; moved for 1 method &#x00028;12 children for S&amp;J and 6 children for P&amp;P&#x00029;. Of the children that moved for the S&amp;J method, the mean paint length was 8.3 mm &#x00028;SD: 17.4; 95&#x00025; CI: 3.4 to 13.3&#x00029;, and the P&amp;P mean length was 3.5mm &#x00028;SD: 11.0; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.4 to 6.6&#x00029;. The mean difference between methods was 4.8 mm &#x00028;SD: 10.1; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.9 to 7.7; <italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029;. For the children who did not move for either method, there was no significant difference between the paired measurements &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .402; S&amp;J mean: 1.0 mm [SD: 1.6]; P&amp;P mean: 0.8 mm [SD: 1.5]&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The S&amp;J method produces more movement and longer paint marks than the P&amp;P method for administering the EpiPen device. The risk of laceration and pain when administering an EpiPen to young children may be lower by using the more controlled P&amp;P method.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Previous cases have revealed a risk of laceration when administering an EpiPen device to children by using the recommended S&amp;J method. Current instructions with the Mylan device caution to hold the leg firmly in place while administering an injection to a young child. It does not recommend the P&amp;P method. Children are often worried about the injection and move their legs. When using this type of autoinjectable device, it may be advisable to change the teaching we give to families with young children &lt;11 years of age to a P&amp;P method, instead of an S&amp;J technique. The need for epinephrine during anaphylaxis is essential regardless of the method used, and it is important to hold the child before administering any AAIs to avoid laceration.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843J">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843J</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To study the safety of direct provocation testing &#x00028;DPT&#x00029; without a preceding penicillin skin test &#x00028;PST&#x00029; in individuals considered low risk for immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029;-mediated or non-IgE&#x02013;mediated hypersensitivity on the basis of clinical history.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 54 pediatric &#x00028;age: 1&#x02013;17 years&#x00029; patients at an academic-affiliated pediatric outpatient allergy clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study. Patients were selected to undergo DPT without PST if considered low risk on the basis of clinical history. DPT was offered to patients with a history of nonspecific rash or urticaria. Patients were excluded if they had a history of &#x00028;1&#x00029; severe symptoms of respiratory distress, &#x00028;2&#x00029; vomiting, &#x00028;3&#x00029; angioedema, &#x00028;4&#x00029; mucosal involvement, &#x00028;5&#x00029; skin desquamation or blister formation, &#x00028;6&#x00029; target lesions, &#x00028;7&#x00029; new onset fever, &#x00028;8&#x00029; joint, kidney, or liver problems, and &#x00028;9&#x00029; required emergent treatment during the index reaction. A single dose of oral amoxicillin &#x00028;20 mg/kg up to 500 mg&#x00029; was given, and patients were observed for 60 minutes. Physical examination and vital signs were performed at baseline and every 15 minutes. If no reaction was noted, the penicillin allergy label was removed from the chart.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 54 patients previously labeled as penicillin allergic but considered low risk received DPT. One patient was excluded from analysis because of a diagnosis of anaphylaxis during the index reaction. The median age at index reaction was 2 years; the median age at DPT was 7 years. Nonspecific rash was reported by 57.4&#x00025;, hives was reported by 38.9&#x00025;, and emesis was reported by 5.5&#x00025; during the index reaction. A total of 9.3&#x00025; reported reaction within 1 hour of exposure, 42.6&#x00025; reported reaction onset &gt;1 hour after exposure, and 48.1&#x00025; were unable to recall timing of index reaction. All 53 patients passed the DPT and had penicillin allergy removed from their chart. No adverse reactions were reported during the DPT, and there were no reports of delayed reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this cohort of pediatric patients with penicillin allergy labels who were determined to be at low risk for immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, DPT without PST was found to be safe and effective in testing for penicillin allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>It has been well established that the majority of patients labeled as penicillin allergic &#x00028;up to 10&#x00025; of US population&#x00029; are not truly allergic. There has been a push to delabel patients, but this can involve several steps, including prick skin testing, intradermal testing, and an oral challenge. The time, cost, and invasiveness of this process may make this less attractive to children and their parents. This study supports other similar studies that, in low-risk patients, a direct oral challenge with observation is adequate for delabeling low-risk patients.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843K">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843K</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the cost of elective evaluation of &#x003B2;-lactam drug allergies in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers included any children, up to the age of 14 years, with a suspected hypersensitivity reaction to &#x003B2;-lactam antibiotics who were seen in the outpatient allergy clinic at the University Hospital of Salamanca, Spain. No testing was done on patients with a history of a nonimmediate severe cutaneous reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was a prospective, observational study performed from June 2017 to May 2018. Testing included skin prick, intradermal tests, and oral challenges. Costs were broken down into direct health care costs, direct non&#x02013;health care costs, and indirect non&#x02013;health care costs. Direct health care costs were calculated on the basis of the number of health care visits and testing performed. Direct non&#x02013;health care costs included transportation costs for families, and indirect non&#x02013;health care costs were estimated on the basis of missed work for visit appointments.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 40 children met inclusion criteria during the year long study &#x00028;median age: 4 years; range: 0&#x02013;13 years&#x00029;. Only 3 patients &#x00028;7.5&#x00025;&#x00029; were diagnosed with &#x003B2;-lactam allergy on the basis of positive intradermal skin testing to amoxicillin. A median of 3 office visits per patient were required for evaluation and diagnosis. The mean total cost per patient for evaluation of &#x003B2;-lactam allergy was &#x00024;308.11 &#x00028;range: &#x00024;116.44&#x02013;&#x00024;835.36&#x00029;, with a mean direct health care cost of &#x00024;125.95 per patient, mean direct non&#x02013;health care cost of &#x00024;22.55 per patient, and mean indirect non&#x02013;health care cost of &#x00024;159.61 per patient.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The cost of elective evaluation of &#x003B2;-lactam allergy in pediatric patients is relatively inexpensive, with a mean total cost of &#x00024;308.11 per patient.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that the majority of children labeled with &#x003B2;-lactam allergy do not have true drug allergy, and avoidance of &#x003B2;-lactam antibiotics is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and use of more expensive antibiotics. This study reveals that outpatient evaluation of &#x003B2;-lactam allergies is relatively inexpensive and may reduce long-term health care costs. Of note, this study was done in Spain, but the authors point out that the total cost of evaluation of &#x003B2;-lactam allergy was similar to that of other studies done with adults in the United States.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843L">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843L</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>A penicillin allergy label is associated with the use of less appropriate and more expensive antibiotics and increased health care use. Many patients with a penicillin allergy label do not have a true allergy and may be safely treated with penicillin. In this economic evaluation study, researchers sought to evaluate whether penicillin allergy testing would be cost-saving.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers included patients with a penicillin allergy label. Input parameters were obtained from the scientific literature pooled by meta-analysis, administrative databases, and technical reports. Two alternative scenarios were compared: in the first scenario, patients were evaluated for penicillin allergy; in the second scenario, evaluation was not performed, with all patients being treated as penicillin allergic. Patients with history of a severe cutaneous reaction for whom reexposure or testing is contraindicated were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>By using Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards guidelines, decision models were built to project whether penicillin allergy testing would be cost-saving. Costs of allergy testing, inpatient bed days, outpatient visits, antibiotic use, and diagnostic testing were considered in 2017 US dollars. A total of 24 base decision models were created, including inpatient and outpatient settings and geographic regions. Diagnostic workflows included sequential performance of skin testing and subsequent drug challenge &#x00028;DC&#x00029; or direct DC. Variants for each model were developed by using data from the United States, Europe, and Portugal. For each model, evaluation of penicillin testing under base case assumptions was performed. Additionally, the number of simulations identifying penicillin allergy testing as cost-saving were evaluated when the values of variables varied under a distribution of probabilities. Uncertainty was explored by using probabilistic sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Penicillin allergy testing was cost-saving in all decision models built. For models including sequential skin testing and DC, the average incremental net benefit was &#x00024;657 for inpatients and &#x00024;2746 for outpatients. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, penicillin allergy testing was identified as the less costly strategy in 70.2&#x00025; of all simulations.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Penicillin allergy testing was projected to be cost-saving across scenarios. Evaluation of reported penicillin allergy and effective delabeling of appropriate patients has economic advantages.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In the current study, the authors suggest significant economic benefit associated with penicillin testing. Additional benefits that are less easily captured include system and patient benefits associated with risk avoidance from alternative antibiotics and therapies and benefits over a lifetime for patients who are not penicillin allergic and are successfully delabeled. The authors note that as many as one-half of patients with negative penicillin testing may not get correctly delabeled or are erroneous relabeled. This highlights an opportunity for future study and opportunities for process improvement initiatives to optimize benefit from antibiotic stewardship initiatives.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843M">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843M</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess the clinical relevance of specific immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029; cutoffs for aeroallergens in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The population studied includes 6-year-old Danish children in the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood in 2000 and 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The distribution of 5 common aeroallergens &#x00028;house dust mite [HDM], cat, dog, grass, and birch&#x00029; were assessed among children in these cohorts at 6 years old. Levels were compared between the entire population studied and children with pediatrician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The median value of specific immunoglobulin E &#x00028;sIgE&#x00029; in children varied across groups; all children had a median sIgE of 0.14 &#x00028;HDM&#x00029;, 0.06 &#x00028;cat&#x00029;, 0.07 &#x00028;dog&#x00029;, 0.33 grass, and 0.2 &#x00028;birch&#x00029; kUA/L; symptomatic children with rhinitis had a sIgE of 6.29 &#x00028;HDM&#x00029;, 1.41 &#x00028;cat&#x00029;, 5.73 &#x00028;dog&#x00029;, 2.43 &#x00028;grass&#x00029;, and 1.97 &#x00028;birch&#x00029; kUA/L. In symptomatic children, the median values were higher and had increased variation. There was significant overlap between the 2 sets, with high IgE levels even in some of the asymptomatic children.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>A uniform cutoff was not found among the allergens tested that discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Currently, there are no established cutoffs for allergen specific IgE levels that distinguish clinical allergy from asymptomatic sensitization. Having clinically relevant cutoffs for specific IgE levels that correlate with clinical symptoms would facilitate interpretation of test results. The authors&#x02019; comparison of allergen specific IgE levels in a prospective cohort of children with a subgroup that had pediatrician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis reveals that there is important overlap of IgE levels between the 2 groups. Similar to food and venom allergy, having detectable IgE has not equate to clinical allergy. In this prospective asthma study, Schoos et al should consider the role of a diagnosis of asthma on the clinical relevance of the sensitization noted, when appropriate to make correlations. Further studies will be needed to determine if allergen specific cutoffs can be established for the diagnosis of rhinitis and asthma.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843N">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843N</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To compare the effectiveness of as-needed fluticasone furoate &#x00028;FF&#x00029; nasal spray &#x00028;27.5 &#x003BC;g; 2 sprays once daily for 1 week, followed by as-needed use for 5 more weeks&#x00029; with that of regular use of FF once daily for 6 weeks in patients with moderate to severe, persistent allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Patients were at least 18 years of age living in Thailand with year-round allergic rhinitis characterized by symptoms occurring &gt;4 days per week for at least 4 consecutive weeks that impaired daily activities, school or work, sleep, or quality of life. Patients were excluded if they had rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, significant deviated nasal septum, asthma or chronic lung disease, recent upper respiratory tract infection, or previous allergen immunotherapy. Patients had a mean age of 30 years &#x00028;SD: 8.4 years&#x00029; and an average duration of symptoms of 15 years, and 95&#x00025; were allergic to dust mites.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Outcome assessors were single-blinded in evaluating outcomes of this 2-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2017 to June 2019 at a large tertiary care university hospital. The primary outcome evaluated was the total nasal symptom score &#x00028;TNSS&#x00029;, measured by summing the score of 4 primary symptoms &#x00028;congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching&#x00029; recorded on a 4-point severity scale from 0 &#x00028;no symptoms&#x00029; to 3 &#x00028;severe symptoms&#x00029;. Secondary outcomes included nasal peak inspiratory flow and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life-36 questionnaire &#x00028;RCQ-36&#x00029;. The study was adequately powered &#x00028;80&#x00025;&#x00029; to detect a 0.16 point TNSS treatment difference between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Disease burden, as measured by primary and secondary outcomes, improved in both groups. The intention-to-treat analysis evaluated all of 108 patients randomly assigned, revealing a nonsignificant trend in TNSS improvement for patients with regular FF use &#x00028;difference: 1.21; 95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;.08 to 2.49; <italic>P</italic> =. 066&#x00029;. Although RCQ-36, nasal itching scores, and rhinorrhea scores were not significantly different between groups, the nasal peak inspiratory flow &#x00028;difference: &#x02212;19.2; <italic>P</italic> = .009&#x00029;, nasal congestion scores &#x00028;difference: 0.42; <italic>P</italic> = .049&#x00029;, and sneezing scores &#x00028;difference: 0.51; <italic>P</italic> = .13&#x00029; favored regular use of FF. Notably, the cumulative dose of FF was far lower in the as-needed group than in that of daily groups &#x00028;difference: 1920 &#x003BC;g; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and as-needed FF use was associated with a lower rate of acne &#x00028;2.0&#x00025; vs 7.7&#x00025;&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Patients using as-needed FF reported a 49&#x00025; reduction in cumulative nasal steroid dose over the study period but experienced similar reductions in TNSS and RSQ-36 score.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Previous studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis have revealed improved symptom control with regular, compared with as-needed, use of nasal corticosteroids &#x00028;NCSs&#x00029;. However, adherence to regular use of NCSs challenges this treatment paradigm in the real-world, where less than one-third of patients regularly use NCS as prescribed. The perfect is not the enemy of the good, and, with this study, the researchers add to a body of literature that as-needed NCS use for allergic rhinitis can be a good option, particularly when considered through a lens of patient-preference&#x02013;sensitive care and shared decision-making. Although this is not a pediatric study, the issue of adherence and cumulative dose of topical glucocorticoid is highly relevant to children. Considering improvements that are possible with as-needed NCS, this option can be a consideration for children who do not have adequate control with a nonsedating oral or nasal 1H-antihistamine. Still, for patients with inadequate control with an as-needed NCS strategy, regular NCS &#x00028;with or without a nasal antihistamine&#x00029; may be even more effective, and additional treatment options, such as specific allergen immunotherapy, remain considerations.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843O">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843O</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of a hypertonic essential oil &#x00028;EO&#x00029;-based nasal spray on perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 43 patients from academic hospitals in France and Belgium were recruited. Participants were &gt;18 years of age, diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, and had a &gt;1-year history of perennial allergic rhinitis and positive skin test for at least 1 perennial allergen.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a multicentric, prospective open-label, nonrandomized study. All patients used Puressential Respiratory-Decongestant Nasal Spray, which is a combination of hypertonic seawater and organic rosemary floral water with 4 EOs &#x00028;ravintsara, geranium, eucalyptus radiata, and niaouli&#x00029;. Subjects were asked to use 2 sprays in each nostril morning and evening for 4 weeks. Participants continued to take their usual allergy medications but were not allowed to add any new medications. Rhinitis control was assessed by using a self-completed questionnaire, the Allergic Rhinitis Control Test. Daily questions pertaining to discomfort and side effects were also completed. Nasal Inspiratory Peak Flow, which is a direct measure of nasal obstruction, was measured at baseline and at 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Statistically significant improvement was documented in both the Allergic Rhinitis Control Test and Nasal Inspiratory Peak Flow. According to ARCT scores, 70&#x00025; of subjects reported controlled rhinitis symptoms at the end of the study, compared with 14&#x00025; at the start of the study. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The use of Puressential Respiratory-Decongestant Nasal Spray, when used as an add-on to baseline rhinitis management for 4 weeks, was associated with an improvement in subjective nasal symptom scores and improvement in objective measurement of nasal obstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>EOs have been previously demonstrated to have antiinflammatory effects. With this study, the researcher yields promising results for a natural way to significantly improve symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis. Although the data are impressive, the study is limited by the fact that there was no placebo group. In addition, although a significant response in a brief time period is encouraging, 4 weeks is not long enough to demonstrate long-term tolerance of intranasal EOs. It remains to be determined if side effects, such as irritation of the nasal mucosa, will occur with long-term use.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843P">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843P</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To study the infant and environmental factors that may contribute to lowered incidence of atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; in preterm infants.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study included infants born from June 1, 2011, to April 20, 2017, at the University of Florida.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this single-center retrospective study, researchers used electronic health records &#x00028;EHRs&#x00029;. The study population was subdivided to those receiving primary care within the UF health system. Inclusion criteria were children who had at least 2 well-child visits, with 1 of the visits being at or after 300 days of life. The diagnosis of AD was determined if certain <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic>, or <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</italic>, codes were used in the EHR record. Demographic, birth, maternal, and clinical information were extracted during EHR review. Independent samples t tests or &#x003C7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare those with or without AD on continuous variables and categorical variables separately. The association of the predictor variables including sex, delivery mode, gestational age, birth weight, and length of stay in the NICU, with AD were examined by using logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Inclusion criteria was met by 4016 pairs of mother and infants. Nearly one-half &#x00028;49&#x00025;&#x00029; of the infants were female. The distribution of race and ethnicity was as follows: 39.2&#x00025; were Black, 38.5&#x00025; were non-Hispanic White, 7.1&#x00025; were Hispanic, and 15.2&#x00025; were other race and ethnicities. The majority &#x00028;65&#x00025;&#x00029; of deliveries were vaginal. A diagnosis of AD was made in 26.6&#x00025; of the included study population. The incidence of AD was significantly associated with delivery mode &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .13&#x00029;, NICU stay &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, gestational age &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029;, and birth weight &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .002&#x00029; in bivariate analysis. Longer gestation, vaginal delivery, no NICU stay, or higher birth weight were associated with an increased risk of developing AD. The lowest rates of AD were observed in extreme preterm infants &#x00028;&lt;28 weeks&#x00029;, and very preterm infants &#x00028;28 to &lt;32 weeks&#x00027; gestation&#x00029;. When AD was modeled with the predictor variables, NICU length of stay was the only one to remain significantly &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .004&#x00029; associated with a lower risk of AD.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>A longer stay in the NICU correlated with a decreased risk of an infant developing AD.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors provide a connection between NICU stay and incidence of AD development. This begs the question as to what factors associated with a NICU stay may contribute to this decreased incidence. In recent years, the human microbiome and its role in disease development have been at the forefront of novel research. Further exploration into the influence of NICU environmental exposures on cutaneous immunity as well as skin and intestinal microbiomes is warranted.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843Q">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843Q</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; patients are commonly colonized with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and staphylococcal biofilms have been described in adult AD lesions. The commensal <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> can antagonize <italic>S aureus</italic>, but its role in AD is unclear. These investigators sought to characterize <italic>S aureus</italic> and <italic>S epidermidis</italic> colonization and biofilm propensity and determine their association with AD severity, barrier function, and epidermal gene expression in an early-life cohort of children with AD.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in Children cohort consists of children aged 1 to 2 years in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio area with either physician-diagnosed AD or a positive parental response to all 3 questions on the Children&#x02019;s Eczema Questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A total of 500 children are being enrolled. The current study was focused on the first 400 MPAACH participants. Demographic, environmental, asthma trigger, and personal and family allergy and asthma history data were compiled. AD severity was documented with the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis scale. Topical medications were withheld the night before the visit. The biofilm propensity of staphylococcal isolates was assessed by crystal violet assays. Gene expression of filaggrin and antimicrobial alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 were measured in keratinocyte RNA extracted from skin tape strips. Staphylococcal biofilms were visualized with scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Among the entire 400 children, 26.5&#x00025; had positive cultures for <italic>S aureus</italic>, whereas 71&#x00025; were positive for <italic>S epidermidis</italic>. A total of 62&#x00025; of staphylococcal isolates formed moderate or strong biofilms, whereas 68&#x00025; of those co-colonized with both staphylococcal species exhibited strains that formed cooperative mixed-species biofilms. Scanning electron microscopy verified presence of biofilms. <italic>S aureus</italic> strains showing higher relative biofilm propensity compared with <italic>S epidermidis</italic> were associated with increased AD severity and increased lesional and nonlesional transepidermal water loss. Biofilm propensity was associated with decreased FLG expression, which otherwise encodes filaggrin, a structural protein essential to prevent water loss.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Collectively, these data suggest that, although S. aureus colonization is associated with increased AD severity, it is the ability of S. aureus to form strong biofilms and the balance between biofilm-forming S. aureus and S epidermidis strains that are particularly important factors affecting AD severity and barrier dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Biofilms are important in many complex disease processes, and atopic dermatitis appears to be no exception. Whether through genetic &#x00028;eg, allergy and filaggrin mutations&#x00029;, environmental, or other factors, the altered skin barrier predisposes to <italic>S aureus</italic> colonization. This jibes with the common clinical observation that acute AD flares are often responsive to a course of both systemic and topical antistaphylococcal therapy while aggressively employing moisturizing measures.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843R">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843R</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition. One foundational component of AD treatment is topical corticosteroids &#x00028;TCS&#x00029;. With this study, researchers sought to evaluate the association among parental-reported health care use, parental TCS phobia, medication use to treat AD, and AD severity in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 1343 children with AD in Denmark.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Children were recruited from the Danish National Patient Registry from January 2014 through December 2018 for this cross-sectional study. Children with a chief complaint and diagnosis of AD on the basis of <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</italic>, codes registered by a dermatology department within the Danish health care system were included. A questionnaire including 158 items assessing family structure, residence, parental education, AD severity &#x00028;assessed by the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM] score&#x00029;, TCS phobia &#x00028;assessed by validated Topical Corticosteroid Phobia [TOPICOP] score&#x00029;, and AD treatment were sent to parents of eligible children.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 3437 children met inclusion criteria, and the parents of 1343 &#x00028;43&#x00025;&#x00029; responded to the questionnaire; the mean age of the children was 8.9 years, and 52.8&#x00025; were male. Mean POEM scores were significantly higher for girls &#x00028;8.2 &#x000B1; 6.3&#x00029; than for boys &#x00028;7.3 &#x000B1; 6.2; <italic>P</italic> = .009&#x00029;, with scores between 8 and 16, indicating moderate eczema. On the basis of POEM scores, 23.4&#x00025; had clear or almost clear AD, 29.5&#x00025; had mild AD, 37&#x00025; had moderate AD, and 10&#x00025; had severe AD. With regards to treatment, 95&#x00025; of all children had received TCS in the past. Severe AD was associated with increased health care visits. With regards to TCS phobia, there was no difference in TOPICOP scores on the basis of AD severity or child age. Higher TOPICOP scores were significantly associated with lower parental educational level as well as delayed TCS application for AD flares but were not associated with increased primary care visits when adjusted for AD severity and parental educational level.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Increased TOPICOP scores were associated with lower parental educational levels leading to delayed treatment of AD flares. There was no association between TOPICOP scores and AD severity or the child&#x02019;s age. Increased health care use was demonstrated in children with severe AD, compared with milder forms of AD, but was not associated directly with increased TOPICOP scores.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although there are no cutoff values for TOPICOP scores to define TCS phobia, in this study, it is suggested that TCS phobia is prevalent and associated with lower parental educational levels and delayed TCS treatment of AD flares. Further study is needed to define the impact of TCS phobia and evidence-based interventions to address this.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843S">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843S</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To look at patterns in treatment of atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; by primary care providers &#x00028;PCPs&#x00029;, particularly of children &lt;2 years of age because there are no specific guidelines for this population.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 52 PCPs from the Chicago metropolitan area were surveyed between April to October 2018. Medical record review included 71c913 encounters of children &lt;2 years and 50c914 of children 2 to 5 years, with an additional 109 patient encounters from the departments of allergy or dermatology at Lurie Children&#x02019;s Hospital, between September 1, 2017, and September 18, 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a mixed-methods study consisting of a retrospective medical record review and survey. PCPs were surveyed by using open-ended and multiple-choice questions about AD management of children &lt;2 years. The survey was analyzed by using quantitative and qualitative methods.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 88&#x00025; &#x00028;45 of 52&#x00029; of PCPs surveyed reported that their management of children &lt;2 years differed from that of older children. The frequency of AD diagnosis was similar across the 2 groups, as was the frequency of topical corticosteroids &#x00028;TCSs&#x00029; prescription &#x00028;1.8&#x00025; vs 1.9&#x00025; of all encounters; <italic>P</italic> = .9&#x00029;. A total of 80&#x00025; of PCPs surveyed reported they think they underprescribe TCSs to the &lt;2 years age group, and 64&#x00025; agreed they were less likely to prescribe high-potency TCSs for these children. From the chart review, children &lt;2 years of age were less likely to be prescribed higher-potency TCSs than children 2 to 5 years were &#x00028;0.37&#x00025; vs 0.66&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01&#x00029; for medium-potency TCSs and 0.05&#x00025; vs 0.15&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01&#x00029; for high-potency TCSs&#x00029;. Children initially treated by a PCP but ultimately referred to a specialist, either in allergy or dermatology, were more likely to be prescribed medium-potency and high-potency TCSs by the specialist provider than by their PCP &#x00028;15&#x00025; of PCP visits versus 30&#x00025; of allergy visits and 57&#x00025; of dermatology visits; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001.&#x00029;</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The chart review data reflect the survey results of PCP perceiving their undertreatment of AD in children 0 to 2 years of age because children 2 to 5 years of age were more likely to be treated with higher-potency TCSs.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Current AD treatment guidelines are not stratified by age, and some recommended therapies, such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, are not indicated in children &lt;2 years of age. In this study, the authors highlight the need for specific treatment guidelines pertaining to this age group. Additionally, patients referred to either an allergist or dermatologist had significantly higher rates of prescription of medium-potency to high-potency TCSs by the specialist provider than by the PCP. Clear guidelines for PCPs on classifying disease severity, guidance on appropriate TCS use in specific age groups, and when to refer patients with AD to specialists may help optimize treatment at the primary care level.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843T">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843T</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate sleep patterns and the development of children with atopic dermatitis at an early age.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 80 children seen in a pediatric allergy clinic at the ages of 0 to 36 months who had atopic dermatitis, did not have any other chronic disease, and did not have a known developmental delay.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study in which the sociodemographic characteristics and clinical information of the patients were recorded. Severity of AD was evaluated according to the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index. The sleep pattern and development of the patients were assessed by the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and by the Guide for Monitoring Childhood Development, respectively. The primary outcome of the study was defining sleep patterns and the development of children with AD.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The median age of the patients was 6 months; 63.7&#x00025; of them were male and 50&#x00025; of them had sleep problems. Male sex, having AD in the first 3 months after diagnosis, and moderate to severe AD were determined as risk factors for sleep problems. In all, 12.5&#x00025; of the patients needed support for &#x02265;1 developmental areas &#x00028;gross motor skills, expressive language and communication, receptive language, fine motor skills, relationship, and play&#x00029;. Developmental delay was higher in patients with sleep problems. Multiple siblings and the presence of sleep problems were found to be risk factors for developmental delay.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Boys with moderate to severe AD within the first 3 months of diagnosis were at increased risk for sleep problems. Children with AD who have multiple siblings and sleep problems should be evaluated for developmental delay and monitored closely&#x0200B;.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This is a unique study evaluating both sleep patterns and developmental problems together in children ages 0 to 36 months with AD. Frequent nighttime awakenings affected particularly the development of gross motor skills. Early detection of such problems may help prevent behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in later years. Further studies in this area are needed.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843U">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843U</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate if an educational handbook could improve atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; symptoms, caregiver confidence in AD management skills, and AD-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included children ages 1 month to 16 years with AD and their caregivers who had scheduled new or follow-up clinic appointments for the evaluation and management of AD at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital. Inclusion criteria consisted of AD diagnosis confirmed by the health care provider during a clinic visit and an English-speaking caregiver.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A randomized nonblinded controlled trial that was stratified to handbook and control arm. In the handbook arm, participants received a handbook in addition to standard AD care, versus only standard care in the control arm. Furthermore, each clinical program from which the participants was recruited was a separate randomization block. These clinical programs included allergy, dermatology, the Atopic Dermatitis Center &#x00028;an interdisciplinary specialty clinic for AD&#x00029;, and primary care. All caregivers completed a self-reported questionnaire at baseline and a 3-month follow-up. After the baseline visit, the participants in the handbook arm were given a handbook and told to read it as a tool to help manage the child&#x02019;s AD. The symptoms associated with AD were measured by using the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure &#x00028;POEM&#x00029;. POEM scores range from 0 &#x00028;clear; no eczema&#x00029; to 28 &#x00028;severe eczema&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 245 patients from the ages of 3 months to 16 years were randomly assigned in this study. Of the total 245 randomly assigned patients, 175 caregivers completed questionnaires and were included in the repeated-measure analysis. There were 91 caregivers in the handbook arm and 84 in the control arm. The patients lost to follow-up were more likely to be African American or Hispanic &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .14&#x00029;. The adjusted mean POEM score &#x00028;&#x000B1;SD&#x00029; decreased from 12.1 &#x000B1; 9.9 to 7.7 &#x000B1; 8.7 &#x00028;difference: &#x02212;4.4 [95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x00028;CI&#x00029;: &#x02212;5.7 to &#x02212;3.0]&#x00029; in the handbook arm and 12 &#x000B1; 10 to 8.6 &#x000B1; 8.8 in the control arm &#x00028;difference: &#x02212;3.4 [95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;4.8 to &#x02212;2.0]; <italic>P</italic> = .343&#x00029;. Confidence scores &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .093&#x00029;, infant quality of life &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .944&#x00029;, child quality of life scores &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .114&#x00029;, and family impact scores &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .933&#x00029; were not significant between time and study arm. The adjusted mean confidence score among new patients increased from 67 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 60 to 74&#x00029; to 83 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 77 to 88&#x00029; in the handbook arm, compared with 74 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 65 to 82&#x00029; to 75 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 67 to 83&#x00029; in the control arm &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .012&#x00029;. Most of the caregivers found the handbook to be helpful.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The use of the handbook did not significantly improve AD symptoms, when compared with standard care alone. Nonetheless, caregivers did find the handbook useful, and it may be especially useful to families managing a new diagnosis of AD.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>As health care providers, we often look for new and innovative ways to improve the care for our patients. Although, in this study, researchers did not find a significant difference in symptom or quality of life outcomes versus standard management, it is not to say another or modified tool would not have the desired impact. Consequently, the analysis of educational resources among various study populations and diseases should continue in an effort to improve overall management and health outcomes.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843V">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843V</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess improvement of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029; disease severity and pruritus with the use of crisaborole ointment 2&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included pediatric patients aged &#x02265;2 years with mild-to-moderate AD from 2 phase 3 studies. The severity of AD was determined by Investigator&#x02019;s Static Global Assessment &#x00028;ISGA&#x00029; score.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either crisaborole or vehicle twice daily applied to affected areas &#x00028;excluding the scalp&#x00029; for 28 days in 2 identically designed, multicenter, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled phase 3 study. The ISGA outcomes included the number of patients and time to reaching an ISGA score of clear &#x00028;0&#x00029; or almost clear &#x00028;1&#x00029; with &#x02265;2-grade improvement from the baseline. Moreover, on study days 8, 15, 22, and 29, investigators evaluated the share of patients achieving ISGA clear or almost clear and/or &#x02265;1-grade improvement in ISGA. The Severity of Pruritus Scale &#x00028;SPS&#x00029; outcomes included the number of patients who reach SPS success. SPS success was defined as SPS score &#x02264;<underline> </underline>1with &#x02265; 1-grade improvement from baseline and the time to reach that success. Furthermore, at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, the proportion of patients attaining a &#x02265;1-grade improvement in SPS score from the baseline were stratified. An electronic diary was used by patients or caregivers to evaluate SPS twice daily through day 29. If there were &lt;2 SPS assessment entries on day 1 for a patient, they were excluded from the data set.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of the 1016 patients enrolled, 874 &#x00028;86&#x00025;&#x00029; were pediatric ages 2 to 17 years and included in this post hoc subanalysis. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between both study arms. Irrespective of the baseline disease severity, a significantly greater proportion of crisaborole-treated patients reached ISGA success on day 8, when compared with vehicle-treated patients. This significant difference continued to be true for those patients with moderate baseline ISGA until day 29. However, after day 8, those with a mild baseline ISGA did not have a significant ISGA difference until day 22. Throughout the study, a significantly larger number of the crisaborole-treated arm reached ISGA clear or almost clear compared with the vehicle-treated arm in both baseline disease severity subgroups. Similarly, in both disease severity groups, crisaborole-treated patients achieved a &#x02265;1-grade improvement in ISGA, compared with that of vehicle-treated patients. SPS outcomes also revealed significant improvement in the crisaborole-treated arm, compared with that of the vehicle-treated arm, on day 8. These SPS outcomes persisted again for the moderate baseline ISGA subgroups through the end of the study. Furthermore, crisaborole-treated patients of both subgroups achieved a &#x02265;1-point SPS score improvement in a significantly shorter median time than vehicle-treated patients did.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate baseline AD saw an improvement in ISGA and SPS outcomes with the use of crisaborole.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors continue to prove crisaborole as a suitable choice as a nonsteroid management option for mild-to-moderate AD. Naturally, independent studies in which researchers comparing crisaborole to corticosteroid standard of care options as well as time to reoccurrence of flares would be of value.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843W">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843W</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the effect of nemolizumab, a subcutaneously administered humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin 31 receptor A and concomitant topical medications and oral antihistamines versus placebo on atopic dermatitis &#x00028;AD&#x00029;-induced pruritus.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter phase 3 study population of Japanese adolescents and adults aged &#x02265;13 years &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 215; median ages: 39 years [nemolizumab] and 40.5 years [placebo]&#x00029; with a confirmed diagnosis of AD, weight of 30 to 120 kg, inadequate response to medium-potency topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors and oral antihistamines, and elevated visual analog scale &#x00028;VAS&#x00029; for pruritus and Eczema Area and Severity Index &#x00028;EASI&#x00029; scores.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive nemolizumab 60 mg subcutaneously &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 143&#x00029; versus placebo &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 72&#x00029; every 4 weeks, for 16 weeks total. Patients in both groups were allowed to continue the use of topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, oral antihistamines, and topical moisturizers. Patients were excluded if they were on other biological therapy, phototherapy, hyposensitization therapies, or other systemic treatments. The primary end point was the percentage change in weekly mean VAS score for pruritus from the baseline, whereas secondary end points included the change in VAS score to week 4 and changes in EASI score, Dermatology Life Quality Index score and Insomnia Severity Index. Intention-to-treat models were used for analysis of all end points with patients who received at least 1 dose of nemolizumab or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated measures was used to analyze weekly scores. The mixed-effects model for repeated measures, analysis of covariance, and intention-to treat analysis were applied to other end points.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>After 16 weeks of therapy, the mean change in VAS score from the baseline to week 16 was &#x02212;42.8&#x00025; &#x000B1; 2.6 in the nemolizumab group versus &#x02212;21.4&#x00025; &#x000B1; 3.6 in the placebo group, resulting in a &#x02212;21.5&#x00025; difference in the 2 groups &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. The initial 4 week change in VAS score was &#x02212;34.4&#x00025; in the nemolizumab group versus &#x02212;15.3&#x00025; in the placebo group, resulting in a &#x02212;19.3&#x00025; difference between the groups. The change in EASI score &gt;16 weeks was &#x02212;45.9&#x00025; &#x00028;nemolizumab&#x00029; versus &#x02212;33.2&#x00025; &#x00028;placebo&#x00029;. In the nemolizumab group, 67&#x00025; of patients had a change in Dermatology Life Quality Index score of &#x02265;4 points, and 55&#x00025; of patients had a change in an ISI score of &#x02264;7 at week 16 versus 50&#x00025; and 21&#x00025;, respectively, in the placebo group. The most commonly reported adverse event was worsening AD in 24&#x00025; of patients in the nemolizumab group and 21&#x00025; of patients in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Patients with moderate to severe pruritus associated with AD, uncontrolled by topical agents and oral antihistamines, who received nemolizumab saw a reduction in pruritus based on several scoring systems, compared with those who received the placebo &gt;16 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;approved biological therapy available for moderate to severe AD is dupilumab, approved for those aged &#x02265;6 years. Although this study included mostly adults, adolescents were included and did show some efficacy for reducing pruritus in AD. However, it is concerning that &gt;20&#x00025; of patients in the intervention group had worsening AD symptoms. Thus, further controlled trials, including the pediatric population, are needed to be able to assess overall effect on AD control.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843X">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843X</ext-link>

Adverse reactions to foods were reported in 16.2&#x00025; of online questionnaires, similar to face-to-face interviews. Most children consumed cow&#x02019;s milk, hen&#x02019;s egg, and wheat products; fewer consumed soy and crustaceans. A total of 10.2&#x00025; were sensitized to at least 1 food &#x00028;positive SPT&#x00029;; sensitization was most common to peanut &#x00028;5.6&#x00025;&#x00029; and hazelnut &#x00028;5.2&#x00025;&#x00029;.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the prevalence, symptoms, and severity of egg allergy, with a specific focus on those with baked-egg tolerance and other associations via a large, population-based study of US households.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged 0 to 17 years with an egg allergy identified by a national survey.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The authors used a US population-based cross-sectional survey administered to a sample of 53&#x02009;575 US households from October 2015 to September 2016. The primary outcomes were as follows: prevalence of current and outgrown egg allergy by using stringent criteria, psychosocial burden, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The overall prevalence of egg allergy was 0.9&#x00025; of all children and 1.3&#x00025; of children &lt;5 years of age. Prevalence appeared to be greater in Black children and in younger children &#x00028;&lt;5 years of age&#x00029;, compared with the other top 8 food allergies. The peak prevalence was between 1 and 2 years of age &#x00028;2&#x00025;&#x00029;, with a gradual decline across childhood, dropping to 0.5&#x00025; in 14- to 17-year-olds. Egg-allergic children were more likely to have atopic comorbid conditions, including eczema &#x00028;19&#x00025;&#x00029;, asthma &#x00028;46.5&#x00025;&#x00029;, environmental allergies &#x00028;38.2&#x00025;&#x00029;, and eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;1.2&#x00025;&#x00029;. Asthma was more prevalent in egg-allergic children, compared with children with the other top 8 food allergies. Baked-egg tolerance was reported among 64.2&#x00025; of egg-allergic children. Baked-egg intolerant children were more likely to be allergic to other foods, especially milk. Among egg-allergic children, 60.2&#x00025; had additional food allergies, with milk &#x00028;35.2&#x00025;&#x00029; and peanut &#x00028;29.3&#x00025;&#x00029; being the most common. Overall, 28.1&#x00025; reported experiencing a severe allergic reaction and were more likely to have had emergency department visits in their lifetime for any food-allergic reaction, compared with children with other food allergies and those who were baked-egg tolerant. A physician diagnosis did not occur in 27.8&#x00025; of children with convincing egg allergy, with no difference related to baked-egg tolerance. A total of 34&#x00025; of egg-allergic children with severe reactions and 25&#x00025; of those without severe reactions lacked a physician diagnosis. There were no differences on the basis of sex, age, race, or ethnicity. Having an epinephrine autoinjector &#x00028;EAI&#x00029; and use of an EAI were less frequent in children without a physician diagnosis, but only 58.4&#x00025; overall had an EAI prescribed. A total of 27&#x00025; of children in the survey reported outgrowing egg allergy, which was often preceded by becoming baked-egg tolerant. Baked-egg tolerance was associated with a better quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Egg allergy is common among young children, with a peak prevalence of 2&#x00025; in children 1 to 2 years of age. Children with egg allergy have a higher prevalence of other atopic conditions, particularly asthma. Increased efforts are needed to ensure that children with an egg allergy are appropriately evaluated to assess for comorbid food allergy, other atopic conditions, and baked-egg tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Egg allergy is often undiagnosed, and EAIs are underprescribed for this population. Asthma occurs in a surprising number of these patients, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion of this as children get older.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843Z">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843Z</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>It has been hypothesized that food allergy may develop through transcutaneous sensitization, especially in the presence of skin barrier impairment and inflammation. With this study, researchers sought to determine if regular moisturizer use in infants could potentially promote food sensitization and the development of food allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This hypothesis was studied in the Inquiring About Tolerance study population. The Inquiring About Tolerance study was a population-based randomized clinical trial conducted from January 15, 2008, to August 31, 2015, including 1303 exclusively breastfed 3-month-old infants and their families from England and Wales.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>At enrollment at 3 months, families completed a questionnaire that included questions about the frequency and type of moisturizer applied, use of corticosteroid creams, and parental report of dry skin or eczema. Infants were examined for visible eczema at the enrollment visit.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed between parent-reported moisturization frequency at 3 months of age and the subsequent development of food allergy. Each additional moisturization per week was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.20 &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 to 1.27; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005&#x00029; for developing a food allergy. For infants with no visible eczema at the enrollment visit, the corresponding adjusted odds ratio was 1.18 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.07 to 1.30; <italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029;, and, for those with eczema at the enrollment visit, corresponding adjusted odds ratio was 1.20 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.11 to 1.31; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005&#x00029;. Moisturizer frequency revealed similar dose-response relationships, with the development of both food and aeroallergen sensitization at 36 months.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>These findings support the idea that regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants may promote the development of food allergy through transcutaneous sensitization.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The notion of transcutaneous sensitization has become popular over the past decade, and there is now an increasing body of research to support it. In short, it is hypothesized that early oral exposure is likely to induce tolerance, whereas skin exposure is more likely to lead to sensitization. This appears to be especially common in infants with eczema, likely because of both an impaired skin barrier and a greater inherited predisposition to develop allergy. It is also interesting to note that other studies have suggested that early and aggressive eczema care might prevent food allergy. There may therefore be a precarious balance, with the likely tipping point being the presence of allergen on the hands of the person applying the moisturizer.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AA">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AA</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To understand the concentration of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid and metabolite derived from gut microbiota, in human milk and the mechanisms of immune tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 109 healthy mothers &#x00028;aged 21&#x02013;42 years&#x00029; were enrolled after term singleton pregnancy in Italy.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>By using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the concentration of human milk butyrate was measured. By using in vivo and in vitro models, the tolerogenic mechanisms of human milk butyrate were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The median butyrate concentration of 0.75 mM was responsible for the maximum modulatory effects observed. In the mouse model, upregulation of several biomarkers important for gut barrier integrity by butyrate was seen. In animal models of food allergy, pretreatment with butyrate significantly reduced allergic response with inhibition of T helper 2 cytokine production and stimulation of tolerogenic cytokines. In human cell models, stimulation of human &#x003B2; defensin-3 and tight junctions&#x02019; expression in human enterocytes by butyrate were seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with food allergy; expression of interleukin 10, interferon &#x003B3; and forkhead box P3 through epigenetic mechanisms occurred. Precursors of regulatory T cells and dendritic cells were promoted.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Butyrate may have a pivotal role in protection against food allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Food allergy is a pervasive problem throughout the world. Breastfeeding is considered to have a protective effect against the development of food allergy, although previous data have revealed conflicting rates of efficacy. The underlying mechanism for food allergy protection has also been unclear. The immunoregulatory effectiveness of human milk may be secondary to butyrate concentration, as seen in this study. The variation of butyrate concentration in individual&#x02019;s human milk may explain the inconsistent evidence for human milk&#x02019;s protection against food allergy from previous studies. Butyrate supplementation to infants or lactating mothers is a potential strategy to prevent the development of food allergy.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BB">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BB</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>In this study, the authors characterize fecal microbiomes to identify bacterial taxa and their products that may influence the expression of food allergies in children and adults.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Participants included a cohort of 18 twin pairs across a broad age range, 13 of which were discordant twin pairs &#x00028;one sibling had a food allergy and the other was healthy&#x00029; and 5 of which were concordant twin pairs &#x00028;both siblings had a food allergy&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>First, fecal samples were collected from the twin pairs who lived in the same household, in which they equally avoided the foods to which the affected twin was found to be allergic. 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the fecal samples from the 12 discordant twin pairs and 5 concordant twin pairs, and the microbial composition between the twin pairs was compared. For each twin pair, the authors compared the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units &#x00028;OTUs&#x00029; and then calculated an OTU correlation score. Next, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the abundance of metabolic compounds in the same set of fecal samples. Finally, the authors compared the microbial taxa and their metabolites and correlated the data sets to identify any bacterial species or metabolites that may be mechanistically related to health.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The healthy and allergic twins exhibited distinct fecal microbial profiles. A bacterial signature of 64 OTUs distinguished healthy from allergic twins; the OTUs enriched in the healthy twins were largely taxa from the Clostridia class. Healthy and allergic twins also exhibit differential enrichment in fecal metabolic pathways, most notably with the enrichment of diacylglycerol in healthy twins. Next, there was a significant association between healthy twins and <italic>Phascolarctobacterium faecium</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic>. These are species from a taxon not previously associated with protection against allergies.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Twin pairs exhibited significant differences in their fecal microbiomes and metabolomes through adulthood, suggesting that the gut microbiota may play a protective role in patients with food allergies beyond the infant stage.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors are one of the first to offer unique insight into the fecal microbiome and metabolome in allergic and nonallergic patients. By identifying bacterial species and metabolites that may be mechanistically related to health, it may be possible in the future to integrate live microbiome-modulating biotherapies into the treatment of food allergies. Oral immunotherapy, which typically achieves only short-term desensitization and often is accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, can potentially be targeted with biotherapeutics to ultimately improve its efficacy and safety. Further investigation is warranted to determine if or how the identified metabolites contribute to protection against allergies.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CC">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CC</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To investigate the phenotypic features of infants who demonstrate immunoglobulin E sensitization to foods that they clinically tolerate. Such understanding may help elucidate strategies in the prevention of food allergies.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A birth cohort of 1074 from southeastern Australia was composed of subjects &lt;32 weeks&#x02019; gestation at time of enrollment and the mother planning to give birth at a local hospital. Participants were characterized as nonsensitized, sensitized-tolerant &#x00028;ST&#x00029;, or food allergic &#x00028;FA&#x00029; on the basis of skin-prick testing and food challenge at 12 month of age.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Environmental exposures were recorded throughout the study period of the cohort. Cord blood regulatory T-cell populations were measured at birth. Subsequent childhood allergic disease was assessed by parent report, clinical examination, and repeat skin-prick testing.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Covariants were assessed among nonsensitized &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 698&#x00029;, ST &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 27&#x00029;, and FA &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 61&#x00029; groups and revealed that the ST group was more similar to the nonsensitized group than to the FA group in the following measures: family history of eczema &#x00028;nonsensitized: 44.6&#x00025;; ST: 44.6&#x00025;; FA: 65.6&#x00025;&#x00029;, pet ownership at 12 months &#x00028;nonsensitized: 71.5&#x00025;; ST: 81.5&#x00025;; FA: 45.8&#x00025;&#x00029;, eczema during the first 12 months &#x00028;nonsensitized: 19&#x00025;; ST: 32&#x00025;; FA: 64&#x00025;&#x00029;, and aeroallergen sensitivity at the age of 4 years &#x00028;nonsensitized: 19.1&#x00025;; ST 28.6&#x00025;; FA 44.4&#x00025;&#x00029;. At birth, a higher proportion of activated regulatory T cells was associated with the ST group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Infants who are sensitized but tolerant have similar pattern of exposures, immunity, and outcomes to nonsensitized infants. An elevated proportion of activated regulatory T cells at birth was specific to the ST infants and may be relevant to the clinical suppression of disease.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Genetic and environmental factors are well known to play a role in the development of allergies. With this study, the authors compare prebirth cohorts to determine more specific factors that may put infants at higher risk for developing food allergies. A robust method of skin-prick testing plus an oral food challenge was used to confirm food allergies. The differences in proportion of cord blood na&#x000EF;ve versus activated regulatory T cells in cohort groups provides insight into a mechanism for the prevention of food allergies.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DD">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DD</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the prevalence of food allergies &#x00028;FAs&#x00029; in adolescents with persistent asthma and see whether concurrent FAs contributed to asthma morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 342 adolescents &#x00028;12&#x02013;16 years&#x00029; with severe asthma who attended the Rochester City School District and participated in the School-Based Asthma Care for Teens &#x00028;SB-ACT&#x00029; trial from 2014 to 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The parent trial, SB-ACT, aimed to decrease asthma morbidity by directly observing asthma medication administration in the Rochester City School District to high-risk adolescents identified as having persistent symptoms or poor control. Additionally, an 18-item FA questionnaire was also administered to the participants and caregivers that assessed a history of physician-diagnosed FAs versus self-reported FAs, foods in question, status of allergy &#x00028;current or previous&#x00029;, and whether diagnostic testing of FA &#x00028;skin test, blood tests, or food challenges&#x00029; was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 101 &#x00028;29&#x00025;&#x00029; respondents reported FAs, with shellfish being the most common &#x00028;38&#x00025;&#x00029;, followed by peanut &#x00028;34&#x00025;&#x00029; and tree nut &#x00028;30&#x00025;&#x00029;. A total of 58&#x00025; of the adolescents did not have an epinephrine autoinjector &#x00028;EAI&#x00029;, and only 13&#x00025; reported carrying their EAI daily. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean asthma symptom-free days in patients with and without FA, but those patients with FA had a higher fractional excretion of nitric oxide. In a linear regression analysis, adolescents with FAs had more days of activity limitation in a 2-week period because of asthma and a higher odds of missing school attributed to asthma than those without a FA did.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>FAs are commonly found in adolescents with severe asthma and can lead to negative impacts on their quality of life, including increased activity limitations as well as missed days of school. Less than one-half of this cohort with FA had access to an EAI, which may increase near fatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In this study, the authors highlight the need to screen adolescents with severe asthma for other atopic diseases, including FAs, to minimize adverse outcomes. Adolescents are at higher risk for fatal food-induced anaphylaxis when they have asthma and if epinephrine administration is delayed. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to not only screen for FAs in this population but ensure both prescriptions for and counseling of proper use of an EAI to avoid adverse outcomes.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EE">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EE</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess peanut feeding guideline implementation by US allergists who manage infants with food allergies.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>US allergists within the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology database.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a cross-sectional survey conducted electronically between September and October 2018. The survey consisted of 31 questions, of which 4 were used to screen out those who were not practicing, did not see infants &#x02264;12 months old, did not manage food allergy, and were not board certified. The survey was performed &#x0223C;21 months after the guidelines were published and &#x0223C;3 and one-half years after publication of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy &#x00028;LEAP&#x00029; study.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Over 3200 surveys were delivered by e-mail. There was a return rate of 29&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 825&#x00029;, of which 789 were completed enough for analysis. Nearly all respondents &#x00028;99&#x00025;&#x00029; advised parents on peanut allergy prevention and performed in vitro or in vivo testing for peanut-specific immunoglobulin E. Nearly all strongly agreed &#x00028;69&#x00025;&#x00029; or agreed &#x00028;28&#x00025;&#x00029; that early introduction was effective in preventing peanut allergy. A total of 97&#x00025; were aware of the guidelines. Of those, 65&#x00025; reported rare deviation from the guidelines, and 34&#x00025; reported partial implementation. The deviations reported erred on the side of caution, not nonchalance. Three clinical scenarios of severe eczema and a positive skin-prick test &#x00028;SPT&#x00029; result to peanut were described and included in the survey. Respondents fully adhered to the guidelines when the diameter of the peanut SPT was small &#x00028;0&#x02013;2 mm; 75.4&#x00025;&#x00029; or large &#x00028;&#x02265;8 mm; 78&#x00025;&#x00029;. Somewhat fewer &#x00028;68.6&#x00025;&#x00029; fully adhered when the peanut SPT was 3 to 7 mm diameter. Only 44&#x00025; fully adhered to the guidelines in all 3 scenarios. As compared with older allergists &#x00028;&#x02265;31 years since med school graduation&#x00029;, younger allergists &#x00028;0&#x02013;10 years since graduation&#x00029; were more likely to use the guidelines as published &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .012&#x00029;, perform graded oral peanut challenges &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001&#x00029;, perform single dose in-office challenges &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0012&#x00029;, strongly agree that early peanut introduction conferred protection against the development of allergy &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0003&#x00029;, and have read the full guideline &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0008&#x00029;. Older respondents were more likely to desire more training on the guidelines &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029; and report that conducting graded challenges &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0008&#x00029; and reimbursement &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001&#x00029; were barriers to implementation. Allergists in academic institutions were more aligned with the younger allergists but identified a lack of clinic time as a barrier to implementation &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001&#x00029;. In contrast, nonacademically affiliated allergists were more likely to identify concern about allergic reactions &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001&#x00029; and legal liability &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001&#x00029; as barriers.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Most allergists are aware of and implement guidelines regarding early introduction of peanut, but barriers to full implementation remain.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>One can look at these results as good news that so many allergists generally adhered to the guidelines &#x0223C;21 months after publication or as bad news that so many more did not. Because the LEAP study was published 2 years before the guidelines, many allergists had already started to adjust practices by the time the guidelines were published. I will say the glass is half full because implementation of these guidelines was much faster than implementation of guidelines for asthma care when the first expert panel report was published 30 years ago. One weakness of this study published in 2020 is that the survey was conducted 2 years before publication. The results might differ by now, but how? Guidelines are just that: advice based on scientific principles. They are not rules or laws, so they must be open to interpretation and adjustment as knowledge evolves and experience grows. Finally, as someone who graduated from medical school 38 years ago, I found it interesting that older allergists were less likely to follow the guidelines than those who were more recently trained. Might it be because their greater experience made them interpret the nuances of the guidelines differently? Or might it be that greater efforts should be made to target older and nonacademically affiliated allergists when new guidelines are published? If either of those or any other explanation is correct, I would not extrapolate from peanut allergy and allergists to other guidelines or specialties.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FF">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FF</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Since the publication of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy &#x00028;LEAP&#x00029; study in 2015 and the addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in 2017, there has been controversy regarding the need and value of performing screening tests in infants at a high risk of developing peanut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 321 infants aged 4 to 11 months with no history of peanut ingestion, testing, or reaction and at least 1 of the following risk factors for the development of peanut allergy: moderate to severe eczema, another food allergy, and/or a first-degree relative with peanut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>After a careful history regarding risk factors and a physical examination focused on eczema severity, the infants underwent peanut skin-prick testing and, depending on the skin-prick test wheal size, a graded oral peanut challenge or an observed feeding with a full serving of peanut.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The median age of the participants was 7.2 months, and 58&#x00025; were boys. A total of 78 had eczema only, 11 had other food allergies only, 107 had a family history only, and 125 had multiple risk factors. Overall, 37 &#x00028;11&#x00025;&#x00029; were found to have a peanut allergy, including 18&#x00025; of 195 with eczema, 19&#x00025; of 59 with other food allergies, and 4&#x00025; of 201 with a family history. Only 1&#x00025; of 115 with a family history and no eczema had a peanut allergy. Among those with eczema, older age &#x00028;odds ratio [OR]: 1.3; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.68 per month&#x00029;, higher severity of atopic dermatitis &#x00028;OR: 1.19; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.06 to 1.34 per 5 points on the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis&#x00029;, Black &#x00028;OR: 5.79; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.92 to 17.4, compared with White&#x00029;, or Asian American race &#x00028;OR: 6.98; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.92 to 25.44&#x00029; and suspected or diagnosed other food allergy &#x00028;OR: 3.98; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.62 to 9.80&#x00029; were associated with peanut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In the study, researchers found that peanut allergy is common in infants with moderate to severe eczema and/or a history of other food allergies, whereas family without eczema is not a major risk factor. This strongly suggests that there is value in screening those with significant eczema and/or other food allergies. Even within the first year of life, introduction at later ages is associated with a higher risk of peanut allergy among those with eczema, supporting introduction of peanut as early as possible.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors provide new and valuable information on an important and timely topic. First, there is value in screening infants at high risk, especially those with severe eczema with or without other food allergies. Second, as was suggested by the LEAP study, earlier introduction appears to be important for these infants at the highest risk. The window of protection may truly be closing by 6 to 7 months of age. Third, and one of the most common questions encountered in day to day practice, family history of peanut allergy without other risk factors does not impart increased risk, providing reassurance that those infants to do need to be tested before peanut introduction.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GG">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GG</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Screening of high-risk infants for peanut allergy before introduction has been recommended, but the optimal approach for screening is not clear. This study sought to compare the diagnostic test characteristics of the peanut skin-prick test &#x00028;SPT&#x00029;, peanut-specific immunoglobulin E &#x00028;sIgE&#x00029;, and sIgE with that of peanut components in a population of infants at a higher risk of peanut allergy before known peanut exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 321 infants aged 4 to 11 months with no history of peanut ingestion, testing, or reaction and at least 1 of the following risk factors for the development of peanut allergy: having moderate to severe eczema, another food allergy, and/or a first-degree relative with peanut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The infants underwent a peanut SPT and, depending on the SPT wheal size, a graded oral peanut challenge or an observed feeding with a full serving of peanut was performed. Additional testing included peanut-sIgE and component-IgE testing. Receiver-operator characteristic areas under the curve &#x00028;AUCs&#x00029; were compared, and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The median age of the participants was 7.2 months, and 58&#x00025; were boys. A total of 37 &#x00028;11&#x00025;&#x00029; were found to have peanut allergy.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To investigate the association between 4 different measures of diet diversity &#x00028;DD&#x00029; during infancy and the development of food allergies &#x00028;FAs&#x00029; over the first decade of life.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 969&#x00029; born in the Isle of Wight &#x00028;United Kingdom&#x00029; from 2001&#x02013;2002.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A prospective UK birth cohort was managed through to 10 years of age. The primary exposures of interest were sociodemographic, environmental, and dietary, assessed by questionnaires, including 4 separate parameters of DD. The primary outcome of interest was the development of FA, which was defined as either a positive oral food challenge test result or a positive skin-prick test result with a convincing clinical history.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Univariate analysis revealed that increased World Health Organization DD criteria at 6 months &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0047&#x00029;, food diversity &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0009; <italic>P</italic> = .0392&#x00029;, food allergen diversity &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0048; <italic>P</italic> = .0233&#x00029;, and fruit and vegetable diversity &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0174; <italic>P</italic> = .0163&#x00029; at 6 and 9 months, respectively, reduced the odds of FA over the first decade of life. Food allergen diversity at 12 months was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of having FA at all time points, whereas eczema in the first year was associated with an increased risk of FA. Multivariate analyses, controlling for significant factors, including eczema, revealed that increased food allergen diversity at 6 months &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0111&#x00029; and 12 months &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0005&#x00029; significantly reduced the odds of food allergy over the first 10 years. For each additional food introduced by 6 months, the odds of developing FA over the first decade was reduced by 10.8&#x00025;. For each additional allergenic food consumed &#x00028;milk, egg, wheat, fish, soy, peanut, tree nuts, and sesame&#x00029; by 1 year, there was a reduction of 33.2&#x00025; in the likelihood of FA over the first 10 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Increased infant diet diversity decreased the likelihood of developing FA, which was sustained over the first decade of life, even after correcting for other significant factors, including eczema.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Doctor, what can I do to reduce my infant&#x02019;s risk of food allergy? It is simple&#x00021; We can advise not to delay introduction of allergens, and, with this study, we can also advise that a diverse diet is likely beneficial. Is this study solid evidence? The authors attempted to adjust for possible biases, but a controlled trial would be needed to confirm this observational study. Nonetheless, there is a potential rationale for their findings. A diverse diet may expose the infant to a broader microbiome, more allergens early &#x00028;inducing tolerance&#x00029;, and diverse nutrients that could have positive benefits to immune responses.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if the early introduction of cow&#x02019;s milk formula &#x00028;CMF&#x00029; could prevent the development of cow&#x02019;s milk allergy &#x00028;CMA&#x00029; in healthy infants.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers enrolled 491 newborns within 5 days of birth from 4 hospitals in Okinawa, Japan. Inclusion criteria were a gestational age of at least 35 weeks, a birth weight of at least 2000 g, and the absence of severe underlying disease.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Participants were allowed to supplement with CMF before 1 month of age and underwent a screening oral food challenge &#x00028;OFC&#x00029; at that time. Those with a negative OFC result were randomly assigned to either the open-label CMF ingestion or avoidance. Those in the CMF ingestion group ingested at least 10 mL of CMF daily between 1 and 2 months of age, whereas those in the avoidance group were instructed to supplement with soy formula if needed during this time. At 3 months of age, an open OFC was performed on all participants. Those who were negative from both groups spontaneously ingested CMF to supplement breastfeeding until 6 months of age, at which time a second open OFC was performed on all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The modified intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significantly lower rate of CMA in the ingestion group versus the avoidance group at 6 months of age &#x00028;0.8&#x00025; vs 6.8&#x00025;; respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Approximately 70&#x00025; were still breastfed, and no mothers had eliminated cow&#x02019;s milk. There were no differences in the rate of eczema or sensitization to egg, wheat, or soy between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Daily ingestion of at least 10 mL of CMF between 1 and 2 months of life decreased the rate of OFC-confirmed CMA in infants. The early introduction of CMF did not impede breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Data supporting the benefit of early introduction of allergenic foods in preventing allergy are accumulating. In this study, researchers examined the impact of introducing a specific daily minimum quantity of CMF in the general infant population, with favorable results. In further studies, researchers could provide interventions in a blinded manner and/or examine the impact of CMF introduction in infants at high-risk of allergy.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843JJ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843JJ</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>During early egg introduction to infants, regulatory immune cells involved in tolerance development were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 124 Australian infants from 2 randomized controlled trials of early introduction of egg for the primary prevention of egg allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Two separate early introduction egg study cohorts &#x00028;BEAT and STEP&#x00029; were managed for 12 months. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells were ovalbumin-stimulated in vitro. Ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells were then identified by flow cytometry detection of forkhead box P3 and interleukin 10 &#x00028;IL-10&#x00029;. Ovalbumin-specific B regulatory cells were detected by coexpression of fluorescence-conjugated ovalbumin and IL-10.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There were decreased ovalbumin-specific regulatory B cells and impaired ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells in egg-allergic infants, compared with egg-tolerant infants. Ovalbumin-specific age-dependent regulatory T-cell expansion was also decreased in non&#x02013;egg-allergic infants who did not introduce egg early.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Ovalbumin-specific B and T cells were correlated with clinical egg tolerance. The timing of egg introduction also correlated with ovalbumin-specific T regulatory cell expansion. This study reveals the importance of the adaptive immune system in food tolerance. Future studies in which researchers evaluate the role and ratio of Th2 to T regulatory ovalbumin-specific cells would be helpful.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Egg allergy is one of the most common pediatric food allergies in the United States and the world. The US-published 2017 Addendum Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy has not formally addressed early egg introduction. Early egg introduction has been associated with a decreased risk of egg allergy. With this study, the researchers support the protective effects of early egg introduction and the underlying immunologic pathophysiology.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KK">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KK</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To review food allergen serum&#x02013;specific immunoglobulin E &#x00028;sIgE&#x00029; ordering practices, single foods versus food panel, by allergists versus nonallergist providers.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Food allergen sIgE laboratory tests performed at a children&#x02019;s hospital clinical laboratory from January 1 to December 31, 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was a follow-up retrospective review of food allergen sIgE laboratory tests performed. The test was considered a multiallergen panel if &gt;1 food was included. Ordering practices were compared between allergists and nonallergists. Allergists were made up of both allergists at the institution and community allergists who used that laboratory.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 12&#x02009;345 sIgE tests were ordered by 400 unique practitioners, including 13 allergists at the institution and 41 community allergists. A total of 89&#x00025; were single-food sIgE tests, and 11&#x00025; were panels. The top diagnoses associated with sIgE food panels were dermatitis, allergy to other foods, and unspecified abdominal pain. Allergists ordered 8986 tests, of which only 1.2&#x00025; were panels. Nonallergists ordered 3368 tests, of which 37.5&#x00025; were panels. The proportion of sIgE tests ordered as panels by community allergists was higher than that by academic allergists &#x00028;1.9&#x00025; vs 0.75&#x00025;&#x00029;. Compared with a similar study from the same center in 2013, there was a 55&#x00025; decrease in the overall number of panels ordered in 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Appropriate diagnosis of an IgE-mediated food allergy requires an appropriate clinical history after ingestion of the suspected food supported by skin-prick tests and/or sIgE tests. The use of sIgE as a screening test is not recommended because of its low positive predictive value. Panels of food sIgE tests are readily available and ordered more by nonallergists than by allergists. Because more individuals will have detectable IgE sensitization than true symptoms, this leads to overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. This, in turn, can lead to nutritional deficiencies and increased health care costs.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although IgE-mediated food allergies appear to be increasing, overdiagnosis is a concern. Most of these food panels were ordered by nonallergists for complaints not typical of an IgE-mediated food allergy. Families are given lists of positive results without truly understanding the limitations of testing. Trying to determine true allergies versus sensitization without clinical symptoms often requires referral to an allergist who will perform additional tests, including oral food challenges. This can be time consuming and invoke additional costs to the families. Although it is reassuring to see the number is going down, at least at this laboratory, there is still a long way to go regarding educating families and nonallergist providers on the appropriate approaches to diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergies.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LL">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LL</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Egg allergy severity and persistence are associated with higher epitope-specific IgE levels to egg-white ovomucoid &#x00028;Gal d 1&#x00029; and immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029; recognition of a larger number of sequential epitopes. Immunoglobulin G1, immunoglobulin G4, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin D may protect against severe reactions; the epitope-specific repertoires of these isotypes were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 38 egg-allergic children &#x00028;mean age: 6.6 years; SD: 3.6; 57&#x00025; boys; 63&#x00025; with anaphylaxis to egg&#x02019; mean egg-specific IgE: 54 kU<sub>A</sub>/L&#x00029; and 6 atopic control children &#x00028;mean age: 10.6 years; SD: 3.8&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A bead-based epitope assay was used to quantitate epitope-specific immunoglobulin E &#x00028;esIgE&#x00029;, epitope-specific immunoglobulin G1 &#x00028;esIgG1&#x00029;, epitope-specific immunoglobulin G4 &#x00028;esIgG4&#x00029;, epitope-specific immunoglobulin A, and epitope-specific immunoglobulin D &#x00028;esIgD&#x00029; directed against 58 &#x00028;15-mer&#x00029; overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of ovomucoid from the egg-allergic and atopic children. The relationships among epitope-specific immunoglobulins &#x00028;esIgs&#x00029; were evaluated by using network analysis. Linear and logistic regression were used to compare esIgs by egg allergy and allergic conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The bead-based epitope assay could detect known IgE-binding epitopes and had high reliability &#x00028;intraclass correlation [ICC]: &gt;0.75&#x00029; and low variability &#x00028;coefficient of variation [CV]: &lt;20&#x00025;&#x00029;; esIgE had the most variability, with 4 modules distinguished, and connected most strongly with esIgG4 or esIgD. Other esIgs were each a single group, except for a subset of esIgG1 that linked the esIgG1 and esIgD groups. Compared with atopic controls, children with egg allergy had lower epitope-specific immunoglobulin A1 &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .010&#x00029; and esIgG1 &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .016&#x00029; and higher esIgE &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; and esIgD &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .015&#x00029;. Adjusting for asthma and age, egg-allergic children with rhinitis had higher levels of 1 esIgG4 epitope. Adjusting for asthma, age, and esIgG1, children with egg allergy and higher esIgD had a decreased odds of anaphylactic reactions &#x00028;odds ratio: 0.48; <italic>P</italic> = .038&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The greater association of esIgE with either esIgG4 or esIgD suggests that esIgE may be secreted by plasma cells in a sequential isotype switch from antigen-experienced upstream isotypes &#x00028;IgG4&#x0002B; B cells&#x00029;, resulting in high-affinity IgE, or directly from IgD&#x0002B; B cells, resulting in lower-affinity IgE.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In this small study, the authors elucidated details of different pathways by which antibody class switching may contribute to specific IgE production, with implications for the epitope specificity, degree of ovomucoid antigen binding, and likelihood of clinical egg allergy. With these finding, the authors contribute to our understanding of why children with egg sensitization may have clinical egg allergy or be clinically tolerant.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MM">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MM</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To validate the predicted ED<sub>05</sub> for cow&#x02019;s milk, which is the allergen dose that elicits an objective reaction in 5&#x00025; of a population, of 0.5 mg of cow&#x02019;s milk protein &#x00028;0.015 mL of fresh cow&#x02019;s milk&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study included 182 children between the ages of 6 months and 17 years recruited from 4 centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain. Inclusion criteria varied across centers. Participants had to have cow&#x02019;s milk allergy &#x00028;CMA&#x00029;, defined by either a clinical history and immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029; sensitization and/or positive food challenge result.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The participants were given 0.5 mg of milk protein as either a single unblinded administration or the first dose of a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge, depending on the center. The predetermined objective criteria for a positive oral food challenge were standardized among centers and included urticaria, angioedema, or rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms that persisted for at least 5 minutes or anaphylaxis. To ensure that all participants had confirmed CMA, clinical reactivity to cow&#x02019;s milk was assessed in participants &gt;1 year of age by food challenge and in those &lt;1 year of age by history of an allergic reaction within 2 months of the study visit and the presence of IgE sensitization to cow&#x02019;s milk. Blood samples and skin-prick testing were used to confirm the presence of IgE to cow&#x02019;s milk in all participants. The proportion of participants reacting to 0.5 mg cow&#x00027;s milk protein was estimated with 2-sided exact 95&#x00025; confidence intervals &#x00028;CIs&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of the 182 children who met the inclusion criteria, 10 were excluded because they did not have clinical reactivity when undergoing the confirmatory milk challenge. Of the remaining 172 participants with confirmed clinical reactivity to cow&#x02019;s milk who underwent the ED<sub>05</sub> 0.5 mg cow&#x02019;s milk protein oral food challenge, objective symptoms that met the predetermined positive challenge criteria were observed in 7&#x00025; &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 3.7&#x00025; to 11.9&#x00025;&#x00029;. One participant &#x00028;17 years old&#x00029; experienced chest tightness, wheezing, a drop in peak expiratory-flow rate, and truncal erythema and was treated with epinephrine. All other reactions were mild and did not require treatment. No predictors of reactivity to 0.5 mg cow&#x00027;s milk protein were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this study population, 7&#x00025; of participants reacted to the proposed eliciting dose of 0.5 mg of cow&#x02019;s milk protein, leading the authors to conclude that 0.5 mg could be a threshold amount of cow&#x02019;s milk protein to inform food product allergy labeling for cow&#x02019;s milk content.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although clear food labeling regarding allergen content and risk of allergic reaction is key to ensuring that those with CMA do not overly restrict their diets &#x00028;while ensuring that they are protected from having a serious allergic reaction&#x00029;, establishing an ED<sub>05</sub> to guide food labeling is challenging because of the striking heterogeneity in clinical reactivity among children with CMA. In this study, the authors highlight these challenges because 1 participant experienced an anaphylactic reaction, which translates to 0.5&#x00025; of the study population. This observation suggests that if foods that contained &#x02264;0.5 mg cow&#x02019;s milk protein per serving were labeled as safe and children with CMA ate those foods on a regular basis, we might expect to see many cases of anaphylaxis. However, there is a substantial degree of uncertainty around the 0.5&#x00025; estimate because the 95&#x00025; CI ranges from 0.01&#x00025; to 3.2&#x00025;, highlighting the fact that much larger studies will be needed to have greater certainty about the expected incidence of anaphylaxis to this dose of cow&#x02019;s milk protein. Additionally, in the study, the researchers found that as many as 12&#x00025; of similar children would react to 0.5 mg, which, rather than validating an ED<sub>05</sub> of 0.5 mg, suggests that the true ED<sub>05</sub> may be &lt;0.5 mg. These aforementioned challenges to identifying an ED<sub>05</sub> are further complicated by the fact that there were no predictors of reactivity to the 0.5 mg dose. Nevertheless, more work is needed in this area because the current approach to food labeling is confusing and challenging for patients with CMA and their families to navigate.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NN">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NN</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess and compare the likelihood of developing other atopic conditions and time to achieve immune tolerance in individuals with cow&#x02019;s milk allergy &#x00028;CMA&#x00029; on the basis of which formula &#x00028;rice hydrolyzed formula, amino acid&#x02013;based formula, soy formula, extensively hydrolyzed whey formula [EHWF], or extensively hydrolyzed casein formula [EHCF] containing the probiotic <italic>Lacticaseibacillus</italic><italic> rhamnosus</italic> GG [LGG]&#x00029; was consumed.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 365 infants &#x00028;1 to 12 months&#x00029; with oral food challenge-confirmed immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated CMA were equally divided into 1 of 5 formula groups &#x00028;rice hydrolyzed formula, amino acid&#x02013;based formula, soy formula, EHWF, or EHCF &#x0002B; LGG&#x00029;, resulting in 73 infants per group.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this prospective cohort study, the research team evaluated each patient 3 times per year for a total of 36 months. At each visit, growth, clinical state, incidence of allergic conditions &#x00028;eczema, urticaria, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis&#x00029;, avoidance of cow&#x02019;s milk protein &#x00028;CMP&#x00029;, compliance with prescribed formula, and skin-prick testing to cow&#x02019;s milk protein and fresh milk were assessed. Oral food challenges were used to assess for tolerance. In the instance that any allergic symptoms developed, families were instructed to notify the research team to further evaluate and diagnose these conditions. Binomial regression was used to calculate the incidence of at least 1 atopic event in 36 months &#x00028;primary outcome&#x00029; as well as development of tolerance to CMP at 36 months &#x00028;secondary outcome&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of the 5 cohorts, the incidence of the primary outcome was lowest in the EHCF &#x0002B; LGG cohort. The cohorts who consumed rice hydrolyzed formula, amino acid&#x02013;based formula, soy formula, and EHWF all had higher incidences of the primary outcome that were greater than the prespecified absolute difference of 0.25, at the prespecified &#x003B1; level of 0.0125. In comparison with EHCF &#x0002B; LGG, the risk ratios of each cohort were as follows: 2.37 &#x00028;1.46&#x02013;3.86; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; for rice hydrolyzed formula; 2.62 &#x00028;1.63&#x02013;4.22; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; for soy formula; 2.31 &#x00028;1.42&#x02013;3.77; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; for EHWF; and 3.50 &#x00028;2.23&#x02013;5.49, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; for amino acid&#x02013;based formula. Individuals who consumed EHCF &#x0002B; LGG also had the highest incidence of immune tolerance to CMP over the 36-month time period.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Patients in the EHCF &#x0002B; LGG cohort had a lower incidence of certain allergic manifestations and a higher incidence of developing immune tolerance to CMP by 36 months, when compared with that of the cohorts who consumed rice hydrolyzed formula, amino acid&#x02013;based formula, soy formula, and EHWF.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In agreement with previous studies, in this study, the authors propose that EHCF &#x0002B; LGG is an excellent option for patients with CMA. With the incidence of food allergy on the rise, it is helpful to have an option for patients which has potential prognostic benefits, including preventing the atopic march and a quicker induction of tolerance to CMP. The limitations such as not including patients with a history of milk-protein anaphylaxis, conclusion of the study after 3 years, and lack of blinded randomization indicate a need for more studies. In addition, it would be interesting to compare the use of EHCF &#x0002B; LGG with the commonly used recommendation of consuming baked milk to accelerate the development of tolerance to CMP.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OO">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OO</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate health care provider recommendations and the breastfeeding dietary practices of mothers with a child who has immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029;-mediated food allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study participants were recruited from online social media groups for breastfeeding mothers or mothers of children with food allergies.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The study included a Web-based survey with the following initial questions as inclusion criteria: having a child diagnosed with an IgE-mediated food allergy by a health care provider before 2 years of age, confirmation of food allergy with blood or skin testing, listing of specific food&#x00028;s&#x00029; to which the child is allergic in the survey, confirmation of food allergy by an allergist, and consumption of breast milk before the child&#x02019;s diagnosis. With the survey, the researchers then explored the mother&#x02019;s consumption of food to which the child has an allergy &#x00028;while breastfeeding&#x00029;, and, if present, reported possible allergic reactions were rated by a board-certified allergist on a scale of 1 &#x00028;highly inconsistent&#x00029; to 5 &#x00028;highly consistent&#x00029; with an IgE-mediated reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 133 mothers completed the survey. A total of 47.4&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 63&#x00029; of mothers reported their health care provider encouraged them to continue breastfeeding without dietary restrictions, 17.3&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 23&#x00029; were advised to continue breastfeeding but avoid eating the food&#x00028;s&#x00029; their child has an allergy to, and 28.6&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 38&#x00029; stated this issue was not addressed. A total of 88&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 117&#x00029; of mothers noticed no allergic reaction in their child while consuming the food their child has an allergy to, and 12&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 16&#x00029; believed their child had a possible allergic reaction. Of the 16 who reported reactions, only 4 were &#x0201C;likely consistent&#x0201D; with an IgE-mediated reaction, most of which were mild. The remaining reported reactions were inconsistent with an IgE-mediated reaction. All 4 mothers completely eliminated the food&#x00028;s&#x00029; from their own diet while continuing to breastfeeding their child.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>This study reveals the inconsistencies in counseling provided by health care providers to breastfeeding mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergy. Most mothers were able to consume the food their child was allergic to while breastfeeding without adverse sequelae.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors highlight the need for further research and unification of recommendations provided to breastfeeding mothers of children with food allergies. Strict avoidance of food allergens by breastfeeding mothers may not be warranted. If reactions are reported, a thorough history should be performed to determine if it is consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction before recommending avoidance in the mother&#x02019;s diet.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PP">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PP</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To investigate the frequency, characteristics, and risk factors of community-based adverse food reactions, including anaphylaxis, among children with food allergies at 6 years of age in a population-based cohort: the HealthNuts study.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The HealthNuts study is a longitudinal population-based study of childhood allergic disease in Melbourne, Australia in which researchers originally enrolled 5276 12-month old infants from community immunization clinics. In this report, 3233 children from this cohort are involved who, at 6 years of age, returned for an assessment. An additional 1222 only completed a questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>All caregivers completed questionnaires, and children underwent skin-prick tests to milk, egg, peanut, soy, wheat, sesame, shellfish, cashew, almond, hazelnut and a panel of aeroallergens. Oral food challenges &#x00028;OFCs&#x00029; were performed for eligible children. Children were identified as definite or probable food allergy on the basis of skin tests and/or a history of food reactions or results of OFCs. A total of 413 children were eligible for an OFC.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 260 children were confirmed as having a food allergy. A total of 44.6&#x00025; reported an adverse food reaction in the previous 12 months, nearly one-third having &gt;1, with 73&#x00025; likely immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated. The most common symptoms were hives and vomiting. The most common foods were nuts and egg. One-half of the reactions occurred at home, with restaurants second &#x00028;11.6&#x00025;&#x00029;. A total of 28 children reported anaphylactic reactions; nearly one-half were not recognized as such by parents. Tree nuts &#x00028;mostly cashew&#x00029; and peanuts accounted for 65&#x00025; of the anaphylactic reactions. Epinephrine autoinjectors were used in only 13.8&#x00025; of all anaphylaxis episodes, only 25&#x00025; of the parent-recognized anaphylaxis episodes, and none of the unrecognized anaphylaxis episodes. There were no risk factors identified for experiencing an adverse food reaction or anaphylaxis, but children with nut allergies were less likely to report an adverse food reaction compared with those without a nut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>A high-frequency of adverse food reactions and anaphylaxis in food-allergic children at the age of 6 years occurred in this population-based cohort study. Only one-half of the episodes of anaphylaxis were identified as such, and only 25&#x00025; of those were treated with an Epinephrine autoinjector. Improved regular education on the prevention of adverse food reactions and recognition and management of anaphylaxis is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Pediatricians and other primary care practitioners need to review avoidance measures, possible symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis, and the importance of epinephrine as first-line therapy for anaphylaxis as part of their well-child care for patients with food allergies.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843QQ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843QQ</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: </title><p>The United States does not have clear requirements for the use of food precautionary allergen labeling &#x00028;PAL&#x00029;. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act requires the names of 8 allergens &#x00028;peanut, tree nuts, milk, egg, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish&#x00029;, if present, to be listed in English on ingredient labels. Additional PAL, such as &#x0201C;may contain&#x0201D; or &#x0201C;made on shared equipment,&#x0201D; is voluntarily placed on products. In the current study, researchers aimed to understand patient and family knowledge of and preferences for PAL statements.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION: </title><p>Individuals with a personal history of food allergy &#x00028;FA&#x00029; or those with a relationship with a patient with FA &#x00028;including caregivers, partners, and teachers&#x00029; were invited to participate in the current study through a survey delivered through the Food Allergy Research and Education&#x02019;s membership listserv. Researchers initially conducted a focus group to understand shopping experiences, understanding of PAL, and preferences for labeling language, format, and placement. A survey draft was sent to 9 additional stakeholders to refine survey reliability and comprehension. Of the ultimate recipients, 25&#x02009;208 opened the e-mail, 3541 began the survey, and data from 3008 respondents were analyzed. Respondents were primarily female &#x00028;84.7&#x00025;&#x00029;, caregivers of a patient with FA &#x00028;77&#x00025;&#x00029;, non-Hispanic White &#x00028;78.4&#x00025;&#x00029;, had a graduate degree &#x00028;40.6&#x00025;&#x00029;, and had an annual household income &gt;&#x00024;100&#x02009;000 &#x00028;48.5&#x00025;&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS: </title><p>Queried demographics included sex, race/ethnicity, education, household income, living location, relationship to FA, type of FA, number of FAs, severe adverse reaction history, and PAL knowledge. Survey domain outcomes included shopping habits, frequency of purchasing products with PAL, PAL preferences, confidence when purchasing PAL products, and PAL discussions with health care providers. Logistic regression analysis evaluated associations between respondent characteristics and PAL outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS: </title><p>Of respondents, 24.2&#x00025; correctly answered 4 knowledge questions surrounding PAL. The majority of respondents never purchase products labeled &#x0201C;may contain traces of allergen&#x0201D; &#x00028;85.5&#x00025;&#x00029;, in comparison with never purchasing products labeled &#x0201C;good manufacturing practices used to segregate ingredients in a facility that also processes allergen&#x0201D; &#x00028;35&#x00025;&#x00029;. The top preferences for desired PAL statements were &#x0201C;not suitable for people with [blank] allergy&#x0201D; &#x00028;29.3&#x00025;&#x00029; and &#x0201C;may contain&#x0201D; &#x00028;22.1&#x00025;&#x00029;. Respondents favor labeling with specific allergens versus a category of allergens. Most respondents favored PAL immediately after the ingredient list. Of individuals with FA, 32&#x00025; were instructed to avoid foods with PAL, whereas 44.5&#x00025; did not discuss PAL with their health care provider. Respondents who were told to avoid all PAL were 59&#x00025; less likely to purchase products with PAL than patients who did not discuss PAL with their provider were.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS: </title><p>Responses revealed lack of awareness of PAL policies and suggest that consumers purchase products with PAL on the basis of specific language used. Consumers desire clarity, specificity, and consistency in labeling. Provider discussions influence purchasing.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS: </title><p>The authors acknowledge limitations of the current study to include potential bias in a sample of patients and caregivers from an advocacy group, which may not accurately represent all patients with FA. Inconsistent labeling practices currently cause confusion and may increase risk for patients with FA. Physician advocacy for improved labeling requirements may benefit patients and families.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RR">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RR</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess the prevalence of immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated peanut allergy to airborne peanut protein and quantify the peanut protein present in the surrounding air.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 84 peanut-allergic children referred to an airborne peanut challenge at Sachs&#x02019; Children and Youths Hospital were included. The majority &#x00028;74&#x00025;&#x00029; had a history of an allergic reaction to peanut; 26&#x00025; had positive test results, with no reaction history.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective case series. Children underwent an airborne challenge to either roasted peanuts or dry roasted peanuts 50 cm in distance away, with 30 minutes exposure time, followed by 1 hour observation postexposure. Patients were examined at baseline and every 10 minutes during the challenge. Electrostatic filter devices were used to collect aerosolized peanut protein and protein was detected by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Measured amounts in air samples were used with confirmed peanut-allergic patients&#x02019; serum for basophil activation tests to assess in vitro if such miniscule amounts could trigger activation of basophils.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>No child in the study experienced anaphylaxis to airborne peanut allergens, and 98&#x00025; revealed no signs or symptoms of peanut exposure; 2&#x00025; of patients experienced mild symptoms, consistent with oral itch and rhino conjunctivitis. Peanut protein was detected in a low amount &#x00028;comparable to the amount that can trigger a reaction in the 5&#x00025; most sensitive patients&#x00029; at 0 m distance from the bowl of peanuts. Detectable peanut protein was dramatically reduced when moving short distances &#x00028;0.5 m&#x00029; from the box of peanuts. Prolonging the exposure time of the filter did increase the peanut protein concentration that was detected.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Severe reactions to airborne peanut protein were not observed in this study, and the majority of patients were asymptomatic. Peanut protein was confirmed in surrounding air and was also shown to be able to activate basophils in vitro at comparable concentrations. However, on the basis of the clinical data, these concentrations of proteins are not expected to lead to significant clinical reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Allergic reaction to airborne peanut protein is often a fear and source of anxiety for peanut-allergic patients and their parents. This study is reassuring that airborne exposure to peanut protein is low risk for occurrence of a severe reaction. These findings could be helpful when counseling patients about risks while trying to minimize unnecessary anxiety or activity restrictions.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SS">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SS</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the effectiveness and safety of peanut oral immunotherapy &#x00028;POIT&#x00029; after 1 year of maintenance in preschool-aged children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 161 patients aged 9 to 70 months who successfully completed 1 year of maintenance POIT and were eligible for follow-up oral food challenge &#x00028;OFC&#x00029;. The inclusion criteria were having a history of objective reaction to peanut and a positive test result &#x00028;either a skin-prick test [SPT] or peanut-specific immunoglobulin E [ps-IgE]&#x00029; or at least 1 objective reaction with dosing during build-up, along with a predetermined ps-IgE level and SPT wheal size.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Preschoolers enrolled in the study were given gradually increasing peanut protein doses over 16&#x02013;22 weeks at clinic visits, building up to a maintenance dose of 300 mg. The children then ingested 300 mg of peanut protein daily for a year. After &#x0223C;12 months, the participants were invited to participate in a follow-up peanut OFC. SPT and/or ps-IgE were obtained at baseline and selectively throughout the maintenance and follow-up OFC visits. Symptoms of allergic reactions occurring were recorded and graded 1 to 5.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of the patients who received a year of maintenance therapy and underwent follow-up OFC &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 117&#x00029;, 92 &#x00028;78.6&#x00025;&#x00029; tolerated a cumulative dose of 4000 mg peanut protein without any symptoms, and 115 &#x00028;98.3&#x00025;&#x00029; tolerated at least 1000 mg. The dose tolerated had increased on average by 3969 mg in those with a negative follow-up OFC and by 3376 mg in those with a positive follow-up OFC. SPT wheal size was also significantly decreased after a year regardless of follow-up OFC result; however, the decrease in ps-IgE was not statistically significant. Those with reactions at the follow-up OFC had either grade 1 &#x00028;14.5&#x00025; of all who underwent OFC&#x00029;, grade 2 &#x00028;6&#x00025;&#x00029;, or grade 3 &#x00028;0.85&#x00025;&#x00029;. No one had a grade 4 or 5 reaction. Of the 124 patients with safety outcomes analyzed during maintenance therapy, 111 &#x00028;89.5&#x00025;&#x00029; were symptom-free during POIT dosing, 10 &#x00028;8.1&#x00025;&#x00029; had grade 1 reactions, 3 &#x00028;2.4&#x00025;&#x00029; had grade 2 reactions, and only 2 &#x00028;1.6&#x00025;&#x00029; required epinephrine for POIT dosing reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>POIT is effective for preschoolers, protecting against at least 1000 mg peanut protein exposure after one year of maintenance therapy in 98.3&#x00025; of children and allowing consumption of up to 4000 mg in 78.6&#x00025;. It is also safe during maintenance, with nearly 90&#x00025; of children symptom-free during maintenance dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>POIT has emerged as a patient-preference&#x02013;sensitive option to increase tolerance to peanut protein and protect against accidental exposure. Previous studies have revealed that increasing the peanut threshold to 1000 mg provides 99&#x00025; protection from accidental exposures, and commercial POIT product is now approved in children 4 to 17 years old. This is the first real-world study revealing that the majority of preschoolers &#x00028;98.3&#x00025;&#x00029; are able to tolerate 1000 mg after a year of POIT maintenance therapy. Mounting evidence suggests POIT may be safer and more effective when initiated at younger ages, likely because of a milder allergic phenotype, less patient aversion, and opportunity for better adherence from close parental supervision. Preschool POIT is a promising disease-modifying intervention that, in the context of shared decision-making with an experienced pediatric allergist, is likely to dramatically improve health and economic outcomes for patients and families.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TT">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TT</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the quality of life &#x00028;QoL&#x00029; of patients with peanut allergy receiving peanut oral immunotherapy &#x00028;POIT&#x00029; at an academic center.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Patients aged 4 to 17 years with a physician-established diagnosis of peanut allergy who opted to receive POIT.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A total of 21 patients underwent POIT between June 2018 and August 2019. QoL scores were assessed with the use of a validated food allergy QoL questionnaires. Changes in QoL scores were measured for each patient before and after POIT.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There was a significant improvement between baseline and successful desensitization to 300 mg peanut protein in the overall food allergy QoL score. Significant improvements were seen for the subscales regarding social and dietary limitations and concerns about accidental exposure and allergic reaction severity. There was a high rate of successful treatment completion &#x00028;95&#x00025;&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>This group reports on successful POIT with improvement in QoL. After treatment, patients had fewer concerns about unintentional exposures and the severity of allergic reactions, with fewer limitations in dietary choices and social interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Previous studies regarding QoL after POIT were done in research settings in controlled trials. This group shows that the improvement in QoL can also be found in clinical settings outside of these controlled trials. QoL is an important outcome of therapy for patients and their families and may help in the decision to undergo OIT or not. Although this was a small, uncontrolled study, results support what many of us have found in clinical settings, that most families want protection from a potentially severe reaction from accidental ingestion.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UU">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UU</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Peanut allergy is associated with impaired food allergy quality of life &#x00028;FAQL&#x00029;. Food allergy quality of life questionnaires &#x00028;FAQLQs&#x00029; are used to provide insight into the burdens associated with food allergy and may be used as an outcome measure instrument. In the current study, researchers examined FAQL changes after treatment with epicutaneous immunotherapy &#x00028;EPIT&#x00029; for peanut allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Data from children between the ages of 4 to 11 years who completed 12 months of therapy during the phase 3 Peanut EPIT Efficacy and Safety Study &#x00028;PEPITES&#x00029; and the first 12 months of the follow-on open-label extension study PEPITES Open-Label Extension Study &#x00028;PEOPLE&#x00029; were included in this study. PEPITES was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the epicutaneous peanut patch &#x00028;DBV712 250&#x003BC;g&#x00029; in 356 children. Enrolled patients had physician-diagnosed peanut allergy and reacted to &#x02264;300 mg of peanut protein on entry double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge &#x00028;DBPCFC&#x00029;. Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive a DBV712 250&#x003BC;g epicutaneous peanut patch or placebo patch daily for 12 months. The PEOPLE study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DBV712 250 &#x003BC;g for up to 5 years of treatment. A total of 298 children enrolled in the PEOPLE study.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>FAQL was prospectively measured at baseline, month 12 &#x00028;before DBPCFC, with treatment allocation blinded&#x00029;, and month 24 &#x00028;before DBPCFC for children initially randomly assigned to placebo, with treatment unblinded&#x00029; by using the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire Parent Proxy Form &#x00028;FAQLQ-PF&#x00029; for children aged &#x02264;12 years, and the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire Child Form &#x00028;FAQLQ-CF&#x00029; for children aged &#x02265;8 years. FAQL assessments were assessed by analysis of covariance, according to between-group and in-group differences by longitudinal controlled repeated-measure analysis. FAQL assessments were also analyzed post hoc by linear regression analysis by using changes in mean and domain-specific FAQLQ-PF and FAQLQ-CF scores from baseline to month 24 as the dependent variable and treatment group and month 12 FAQLQ assessments as independent variables.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>FAQLQs were analyzed from placebo &#x00028;FAQLQ-PF: 96; FAQLQ-CF: 47&#x00029; and treatment participants &#x00028;FAQLQ-PF: 209; FAQLQ-CF: 105&#x00029;. At 24 months, global FAQL scores were significantly improved in the treatment group &#x00028;least squares mean [LSM]: 0.34 [<italic>P</italic> = .008] and 0.46 [<italic>P</italic> = .023]&#x00029;. At 24 months, there were significant FAQLQ-PF score improvements in patients initially randomly assigned to treatment who met the efficacy primary end point &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 74; LSM: 0.55 [<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001]&#x00029; and in participants with any eliciting dose &#x00028;ED&#x00029; increase &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 127; LSM, 0.66; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Improvements in FAQLQ-PF were observed in social dietary limitations, food-related anxiety, and emotional impact domains. Improvements in FAQLQ-CF were observed in risk of accidental exposure and allergen avoidance domains.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>EPIT was associated with significant global and domain-specific FAQL improvement, largely driven by increases in ED.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>These findings suggest that EPIT had a meaningful impact on the lives of patients and caregivers. Although there may be some bias toward positive survey responses from caregivers and patients who were satisfied with their outcomes, this encouraging study reveals a measurable modality for capturing outcome perceptions. Additional study of ongoing peanut EPIT is needed to better understand the clinical relationship between intermediate and long-term ED changes, efficacy, safety, and FAQL.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VV">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VV</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To prospectively define the incidence of food protein&#x02013;induced allergic proctocolitis &#x00028;FPIAP&#x00029; and identify risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Newborn infants &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 903&#x00029; from a single suburban, private, primary pediatrics practice in Massachusetts from April 2014 to February 2017: Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Allergic Proctocolitis cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Infants were recruited at their initial newborn visit and managed prospectively at routine well-child checks and sick visits for a diagnosis of FPIAP. The primary outcome was pediatrician-diagnosed FPIAP, which was then confirmed by research staff by using prespecified inclusion criteria, including documentation of gross or occult blood in the stool.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The recruited cohort was predominately male &#x00028;54&#x00025;&#x00029;, White &#x00028;69&#x00025;&#x00029;, term &#x00028;89&#x00025;&#x00029;, and delivered vaginally &#x00028;68&#x00025;&#x00029;. A cumulative incidence of 17&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 153&#x00029; of infants met inclusion criteria for a FPIAP diagnosis. The median age at symptom onset was 26 days, and the median age at FPIAP diagnosis was 35 days. Of the FPIAP cases, 41&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 63&#x00029; had gross blood, and 37&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 56&#x00029; had mucus with microscopic blood in their stool. The median age of symptom resolution was 123 days. Risk factors for FPIAP included a first-degree relative with food allergy &#x00028;odds ratio [OR]: 1.9; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 2.8; <italic>P</italic> = .005&#x00029;, eczema &#x00028;OR: 1.5; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.1 to 2.2; <italic>P</italic> = .02&#x00029;, and household pets at birth &#x00028;OR: 1.5; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.01 to 2.1; <italic>P</italic> = .043&#x00029;. Infants initially fed both breast milk and formula were 61&#x00025; less likely to develop FPIAP, compared with infants exclusively formula fed &#x00028;hazard ratio [HR]: 0.39; <italic>P</italic> = .005&#x00029;. Infants fed both breast milk and formula at any point during the first 4 months were 56&#x00025; less likely than exclusively formula-fed infants and 38&#x00025; less likely than exclusively breastfed infants to develop FPIAP &#x00028;HR: 0.44 [<italic>P</italic> = .005]; HR: 0.62 [<italic>P</italic> =.0497].</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>When diagnosed clinically by community pediatricians, without confirmatory oral challenge, the prospectively defined FPIAP incidence is markedly higher than previous published estimates.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>FPIAP is generally considered a mild, self-limited, non&#x02013;immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated food allergy &#x00028;with cow&#x02019;s milk protein the most common trigger&#x00029; found in otherwise healthy infants. There is a lack of validated diagnostic criteria, but elimination diet and rechallenge have been proposed. Diagnosis based solely on occult blood is controversial. This prospective observational cohort study found an exceptionally high rate of diagnosis by using the criteria applied and is possibly biased by the single-center design. This is not a criticism&#x00021; It raises many important questions about infants presenting with gross or occult fecal blood. Interestingly, many of the infants had associated gagging, vomiting, food refusal, reflux, and/or irritability. Are there alternative diagnoses among this cohort? Do we need firmer diagnostic criteria? These findings underscore the need for exploring this population with gross or occult blood in the stool to better understand diagnoses, causes, and treatments. A follow-up analysis of this cohort revealed that children with the FPIAP diagnosis had a twofold risk of developing immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated food allergy, even when accounting for atopic dermatitis as a risk &#x00028;Martin VM, Virkud YV, Phadke NA, et al. Increased IgE-mediated food allergy with food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis. <italic>Pediatrics</italic>. 2020;146[3]:e20200202&#x00029;. This could be explained by a shared pathophysiology, or the possibility that dietary elimination was a risk factor. Because symptoms of FPIAP are often not reproduced by reexposure, there may be an unnecessary risk imposed by presumptive dietary elimination. Although, in the study, the researchers raise fascinating questions, it is important to strongly consider confirming a food trigger. Earlier milk reintroduction attempts in infants with FPIAP are thus encouraged.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WW">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WW</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the relationship between food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis &#x00028;FPIAP&#x00029; and the risk of developing immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated food allergy &#x00028;IgE-FA&#x00029; in infants.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 903 infants who were enrolled in the Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Allergic Proctocolitis &#x00028;GMAP&#x00029; cohort, an observational healthy-infant cohort study in which researchers characterized the epidemiology of FPIAP in the primary care setting.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Infants diagnosed with FPIAP with presence of documented blood in the stool were included. IgE-FA was determined by 2 allergists independently reviewing clinical and sensitization data from children whose parents reported suspect reactions and included if both reviewers agreed the diagnosis was &#x0201C;confirmed&#x0201D; or probable.&#x0201D; The rate of IgE-FA was compared between healthy infants and those with FPIAP. Additional variables, including the presence of eczema, were evaluated by using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>More children with FPIAP developed IgE-FA &#x00028;11&#x00025;&#x00029;, compared with healthy children &#x00028;5&#x00025;&#x00029;. Adjusting for eczema, children with FPIAP had twice the odds of developing IgE-FA to any food. FPIAP was most strongly associated with IgE-FA to milk, although the study was not powered to detect relationships to individual foods.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Children with FPIAP were at an increased risk for having IgE-FA. This may be multifactorial, including shared pathogenesis in the development of FPIAP and IgE-FA and/or an effect of antigen elimination diet used to treat FPIAP.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>FPIAP is a common diagnosis early in infancy that is benign and self-resolved. However, a diagnosis of FPIAP often leads to prolonged dietary restriction from cow&#x02019;s milk &#x00028;the most common cause&#x00029; and potentially soy protein as well. Although conventional teaching is to wait until 12 months of age to reintroduce dairy to infants with FPIAP, it can likely be introduced much earlier. In this study, researchers found an association between a diagnosis of FPIAP with increased risk for IgE-FA, although diagnosis was not confirmed through oral food challenges. Although the authors report some potential common immunologic pathways between FPIAP &#x00028;a non&#x02013;immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated food reaction&#x00029; and IgE-FA, a true causative effect has not been established. Now that current evidence-based guidelines recommend early introduction of allergenic foods to all infants &#x00028;beginning &#x0223C;4-6 months of age&#x00029; and ongoing inclusion in the diet as the best path toward food allergy prevention, with this study, the authors reinforce the need for pediatricians to discuss these guidelines with parents. This is especially true in infants at a higher risk to develop food allergy, including those with severe or persistent atopic dermatitis and now, potentially, other forms of non&#x02013;immunoglobulin&#x02013;mediated food allergy. Now, more than ever, we need to let the infants eat&#x00021;</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XX">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XX</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess time to resolution of food protein&#x02013;induced allergic proctocolitis &#x00028;FPIAP&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers evaluated 76 infants aged &lt;4 months with rectal bleeding &#x00028;RB&#x00029; referred to the pediatric gastrointestinal department at Trousseau Hospital in Paris, France, between May 2014 and December 2017. Only infants whose RB responded to a cow&#x02019;s milk elimination diet were included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a prospective cohort of infants with concern for cow&#x02019;s milk protein &#x00028;CMP&#x00029; allergy who had resolution of RB with CMP elimination. Exclusion criteria included RB because of another etiology and exclusively breastfed infants. A total of 2 to 8 weeks after resolution of RB, CMP oral food challenge &#x00028;OFC&#x00029; was completed. If FPIAP was confirmed, OFC was repeated every 2 months after the age of 4 months to assess the time to tolerance of CMP. Ongoing FPIAP CMP was defined as RB, behavioral change, diarrhea, and vomiting. Tolerance was defined as CMP daily without symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Only 31&#x00025; of the cohort failed OFC at initial diagnostic challenge, meaning that over two-thirds of infants who initially responded to CMP exclusion did not have return of symptoms on rechallenge just weeks later. Of the patients confirmed to have FPIAP CMP, the median age of tolerance was determined to be 6.8 months, with &gt;75&#x00025; of the cohort tolerant by 10 months. Infants with a first-degree family history of atopic disease developed tolerance later &#x00028;8.9 months versus 5.1 months&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this work, it was confirmed that the majority of RB in infants is likely not related to FPIAP CMP. This study also revealed that the time to resolution might be earlier than previously thought.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although there are no solid guidelines on introduction of CMP in presumed FPIAP CMP, the majority of patients exclude CMP until approximately 1 year. In this study, it was found that only one-third of RB before 4 months was due to FPIAP. Of those with FPIAP, CMP could be challenged earlier and at more frequent intervals depending on family wishes. A major limitation of this study is that exclusively breastfed infants were excluded and the lack of information on maternal diet in those who were nursing.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YY">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YY</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY:</title><p>To examine the clinical course and risk factors of food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis &#x00028;FPIAP&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 257 infants who presented to 5 outpatient pediatric allergy or gastroenterology clinics with rectal bleeding and were given a diagnosis of FPIAP were included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>After enrollment, infants had serum immunoglobulin E testing, skin-prick testing &#x00028;SPT&#x00029;, and complete blood cell count. Clinical characteristics were prospectively managed. Patients with other known gastrointestinal illnesses were excluded. Cow&#x02019;s milk elimination was trialed first in both the infant&#x02019;s diet as well as the mother&#x02019;s diet if breastfeeding, and, if no improvement, egg was eliminated next. Combined elimination of wheat, nuts, and soy followed, if no improvement. Eliminated foods were then reintroduced after 2 to 4 weeks, and a worsening of symptoms confirmed diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There was no sex predominance, with 50.2&#x00025; being female &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 129&#x00029;. The vast majority were breastfed at diagnosis &#x00028;97.2&#x00025;&#x00029;, with 66.5&#x00025; exclusively breastfed. Blood in stool was present in every case, and other common complaints were mucous in stool &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 224&#x00029; and loose stool &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 168&#x00029;. Cow&#x02019;s milk was the most common causative food, accounting for 99.2&#x00025; of cases. Comparing those with only 1 food allergy &#x00028;75.9&#x00025;&#x00029; versus those with multiple food allergies, children with a single-food allergy more often were exclusively breastfeeding at diagnosis, had a longer duration of breastfeeding, had less antibiotic use in the first 6 months, and had higher tolerance development &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .003, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001, and &lt; 0.001, respectively&#x00029;. Immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029; sensitization was assessed in 239 patients, and 55 &#x00028;23&#x00025;&#x00029; had positive test results. Sensitized children less often developed tolerance to the offending allergen compared with nonsensitized children &#x00028;52.4&#x00025; versus 81.2&#x00025;&#x00029;. Only 16 patients underwent endoscopy and were continued to be treated as having FPIAP.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Most patients with FPIAP resolve within a year. Infants with colic, IgE sensitization, and multiple food allergies may be at risk for delayed tolerance. Cow&#x02019;s milk should be the first excluded food in infants and breastfeeding mothers, and elimination should resolve symptoms in most patients. Breastfeeding and lower antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in the development of multiple food allergies. The role of SPT and IgE testing is still unclear and may not add benefit to most cases. Endoscopy did not change management, even in severe cases.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This is an important study that characterizes a common condition. The prospective nature of this study is a strength, along with high retention of subjects throughout the study. The involvement of multiple centers and specialties introduced some variability in practice. More severe cases of FPIAP are likely represented in this study because subjects had referral to allergy or gastroenterology specialists. Also, the high prevalence of breastfeeding in this cohort may limit its generalizability to other communities; regional food preferences and breastfeeding prevalence may have a large effect on the development of allergies and food sensitization.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZ</ext-link>

Twelve had positive SPT or sIgE to CM, 3 were positive to egg, and 3 had positive test results to CM and egg &#x00028;the median sIgE to CM was 0.5 kUA/L; the median IgE to egg was 2.1 kUA/L at FPIAP onset&#x00029;. The median age of tolerance to FPIAP trigger foods in group 2 was 11 months &#x00028;IQR: 9.5&#x02013;12&#x00029;. Group 3 developed IgE-mediated symptoms to trigger foods at a median age of 5 months &#x00028;IQR: 5&#x02013;6&#x00029;. The median age of tolerance to IgE-mediated FPIAP triggering foods was 19 months &#x00028;IQR: 18.0&#x02013;29.0&#x00029;. Children with multiple food FPIAP developed tolerance later than those with single-food FPIAP &#x00028;the median age for multiple food FPIAP groups was 13 months [IQR: 11&#x02013;16] versus that of single-food FPIAP, which was 11 months [IQR: 10&#x02013;13]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>On the basis of this study, some infants with FPIAP may transition to different food allergy clinical phenotypes, including IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to FPIAP triggering foods. Although all infants in the study developed tolerance, there was a delay in tolerance development among infants who transitioned to IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, compared with that of other groups. Those with multiple food FPIAP also had delayed tolerance when compared with infants with single-food FPIAP.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Because of the retrospective nature, the strength of the conclusions are limited by a lack of systematic timing of challenge to trigger foods in infants with FPIAP and IgE-mediated allergy. Nonetheless, this information can be useful in counseling families regarding the likely time to resolution when concomitant IgE-mediated symptoms occur in individuals initially diagnosed with FPIAP and those with multiple food FPIAP. Unfortunately, they were not able to determine risk factors for development of IgE-mediated allergy in these infants with FPIAP. Further prospective studies are needed.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAA">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAA</ext-link>

As noted above, the reaction can include severe and multiple symptoms. This type of food allergy is not IgE-mediated, so skin-prick tests and serum food-specific IgE are typically negative. Many FPIES symptoms mimic viral infections or sepsis, and, indeed, the white blood cell count is often elevated with a &#x0201C;left shift.&#x0201D; This cohort from a lay organization may represent patients with a more severe presentation than typical, but the lessons are clear: suspect FPIES when the cardinal features are noted and no additional explanation arises, and do not be fooled if typically &#x0201C;innocent&#x0201D; foods like rice, oat, avocado, banana, or sweet potato are implicated&#x00021;</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBB">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBB</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if very early onset eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;V-EoE&#x00029; represents a separate disease endotype, with worse clinical features and prognosis, distinct molecular properties, and specific risk factors, compared with that of later-onset pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;L-EoE&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers included patients diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;EoE&#x00029; at the age of &#x02264;12 months &#x00028;V-EoE: <italic>n</italic> = 57&#x00029; and at the age of 14 to 18 years &#x00028;L-EoE: <italic>n</italic> = 70&#x00029;. The diagnostic criteria for EoE included symptoms of esophageal dysfunction or inflammation and at least 15 eos/hpf in distal esophageal biopsy despite proton pump inhibitor use.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A single-center retrospective chart review was focused on demographics and clinical history. Pretreatment histologic and gross endoscopic features were graded by using the EoE Histology Scoring System and the EoE Endoscopic Reference Score. RNA was extracted from a cohort of 15 pretreatment patients and analyzed via the EoE Diagnostic Panel, which is used to distinguish EoE from gastroesophageal reflux. With genetic analysis, the researchers examined whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>CAPN14</italic> and <italic>TSLP</italic> were associated with age of diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>EoE was most commonly diagnosed at the age of 0 to 24 months. The V-EoE group was more likely to present with feeding issues, weight concerns, and vomiting, compared with that of dysphagia in the L-EoE group. Patients with V-EoE were more likely to have a history of cesarean delivery. Dietary restriction was more likely to be the initial and successful therapy in in the V-EoE group, whereas the L-EoE group was more likely to respond to swallowed steroids. Histologic remission was sustained in patients with V-EoE and was less common in patients with L-EoE, likely due to therapy nonadherence. The V-EoE group demonstrated higher levels of inflammation on histology, whereas esophageal strictures and fibrosis were more common in the L-EoE group. EDP molecular expression was similar between the 2 groups. Genetic analysis&#x02013;identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>CAPN14</italic> were associated with V-EoE.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>V-EoE is associated with unique clinical, histologic, and genetic features. The increased incidence of cesarean delivery in patients with V-EoE may indicate a role of early-life dysbiosis. Patients with V-EoE can be managed successfully with standard therapy and achieve sustained remission. Fibrostenosis and esophageal dilation were more likely in L-EoE.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>V-EoE is a clinically important entity, requiring prompt recognition and diagnosis to initiate treatment. In a patient with recurrent emesis, feeding difficulties, and poor weight gain, consider endoscopy to evaluate for EoE. Risk factors include cesarean delivery and <italic>CAPN14</italic> variants. Successful management of V-EoE can be attained with standard therapy and may prevent late-stage complications related to esophageal remodeling.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CCC">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CCC</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To characterize patient-reported symptoms and comorbidities by type of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease &#x00028;EGID&#x00029; and compare the collected data among the evaluated patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 715 pediatric and adult patients with a diagnosis of EGID were enrolled in the Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disease Researchers Contact Registry and completed the study questionnaire between 2015 and 2018. EGIDs consisted of eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;EoE&#x00029; or non-EoE EGIDs, which consist of eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and eosinophilic colitis.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was a cross-sectional study. A 25-item questionnaire was curated to collect demographic data, types of EGID, symptoms, and management. Additionally, extraintestinal symptoms and various comorbidities were recorded, such as vitamin deficiencies and psychosocial comorbidities.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Most patients who completed the questionnaire had EoE only &#x00028;80&#x00025;; <italic>n</italic> = 575&#x00029;, in comparison with those with non-EoE EGIDs with or without EoE &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 210&#x00029;. The sex-distribution illustrated that boys &#x00028;57&#x00025;&#x00029; and younger patients reported EoE only, in comparison with non-EoE EGIDs &#x00028;16- vs 19-year-olds&#x00029;, which was statistically significant. Nausea &#x00028;21&#x00025;&#x00029; and upper abdominal pain &#x00028;23&#x00025;&#x00029; were the most prominent symptoms reported. Of note, the frequency of symptoms was higher among those with non-EoE EGIDs. Furthermore, patients with non-EoE EGIDs had a higher percentage of vitamin deficiencies &#x00028;49.7&#x00025;&#x00029; and concomitant gastroparesis &#x00028;27.3&#x00025;&#x00029;. Every patient in the study reported extraintestinal symptoms, but those with non-EoE EGID reported an increased frequency &#x00028;14 to 21&#x00025; experienced weekly symptoms&#x00029; and psychosocial concerns &#x00028;16&#x00025; to 26&#x00025; experienced weekly symptoms&#x00029;. Adult EoE patients had a higher proportion of feeling isolated on a daily or weekly basis when treated with specific food-elimination diets. Similar outcomes were seen in both pediatric and adult EoE patients being treated with elemental diet therapy. After adjusting for food avoidance behaviors and diarrhea frequency, both specific food-elimination &#x00028;odds ratio: 2.4&#x00029; and elemental diet &#x00028;odds ratio: 1.9&#x00029; were still associated with at least weekly feelings of isolation for participants with EoE only.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>As a whole, patients with EGID have a high frequency of extragastrointestinal symptoms and a high reporting rate of comorbidities. When examining these disorders closely, patients with non-EoE EGIDs had more severe symptoms and a higher occurrence of nutritional, physical, and psychosocial comorbidities, in comparison with those with EoE only.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>From a diagnostic perspective, with this study, the authors illustrate poignant differences in the symptom presentation and laboratory findings &#x00028;vitamin deficiencies&#x00029; that may assist health care providers in determining the accurate diagnosis between EGIDs. Additionally, with this study, the authors are the first to highlight how impactful treatment plans are on patients psychosocially. EoE and other EGID disorders, when treated with restrictive dietary modifications, can have a negative impact on patients, particularly adolescents, and their social interactions. This outcome indicates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in treatment and encourages more research to look for options that are not perceived as burdensome by the patient.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDD">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDD</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if patients with eosinophilic esophagitis &#x00028;EoE&#x00029; have decreased bone mineral density &#x00028;BMD&#x00029; more than what would be expected for their age and determine if the decreased bone density is more associated with certain comorbidities or treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 269 patients with EoE were evaluated at the Cincinnati Children&#x02019;s Hospital Medical Center Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic. The inclusion criteria were patients 3 to 21 years who have a diagnosis of EoE on the basis of clinical history and pathology and have undergone a lumbar spine dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry &#x00028;DXA&#x00029; scan between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was a retrospective chart review. Specifically, charts were evaluated to find the patient&#x02019;s first DXA scan within the study period. Demographic data included age at the time of the scan and EoE disease burden. Investigators also documented any comorbidities such as history of atopic disease, connective tissue diseases, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and immunoglobulin E &#x00028;IgE&#x00029;-mediated food allergies. Treatment information collected included corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors &#x00028;PPIs&#x00029;, 5-food and 6-food elimination diet, and elemental diet. From each chart, they noted if patients had ever been on these treatments in their lifetime, within the year preceding the DXA scan, or at the time of the DXA scan.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The mean lumbar spine BMD <italic>z</italic> score of &#x02212;0.5 was lower than the expected value of 0, and the prevalence of low BMD was 8.6&#x00025; in comparison with the predicted value of 2.5&#x00025;, both statistically significant. By using predictive multivariate models, PPI use at any point in the patient&#x02019;s lifetime, the 5-food or 6-food elimination diet, and a history of IgE-mediated food allergies had negative correlations with BMD scores &#x00028;&#x02212;0.65, &#x02212;0.27, and &#x02212;0.28, respectively&#x00029;. Boys were at an increased risk of low BMD scores &#x00028;odds ratio &#x00028;OR&#x00029;: 4.84&#x00029;. Of note, corticosteroid use was not associated with lower BMD scores. Patients with a higher BMI, with a higher height-for-age, and who had active EoE were less likely to have a low BMD &#x00028;OR: 0.43, OR: 0.33, and OR: 0.34, respectively&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Pediatric patients with EoE have a lower BMD than their peers and a higher prevalence of low BMD. Risk factors to consider for these patients to develop low BMD include a history of IgE-mediated food allergies. Treatments such as restrictive food-elimination diets and PPI use also increase the risk of these patients developing lower BMD.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>There is prominent use of PPIs in pediatric patients with EoE, both to treat esophageal inflammation and protect the gastric mucosa with steroids treatment. Additionally, the use of dietary modifications to eliminate potential triggers is commonly used to treat EoE. Although both forms of treatments are effective in managing EoE, in this study, it is indicated that there may be negative impacts on bone health that should be considered in their management plan. Because this study is a retrospective analysis, it supports the need for a prospective study to evaluate factors that contribute to low BMD in pediatric patients with EoE and potential screening tools to identify those at greater risk of low BMD in this population.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FFF">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FFF</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Previous evidence has revealed an effect of environmental tobacco smoke &#x00028;ETS&#x00029; exposure on the development of childhood asthma. However, few studies have investigated the link between prenatal ETS exposure and adult-onset asthma. Therefore, in this study, we aim to determine if an association exists between adult-onset asthma and prenatal ETS exposure. Genetic predisposition to the development of asthma was also examined in conjunction with prenatal ETS exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This study was comprised of mothers and their offspring who were included in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort in 1966, a total of 12053 births. Data were collected from 7148 subjects, and 5491 met the inclusion criteria. The final study population consisted of 5200 subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Analysis was conducted on maternal smoking status in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and asthma status was conducted at 31 and 46 years of age &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 5200&#x00029;. Questionnaire data were collected from subjects at 31 and 46 years of age regarding history of asthma or wheeze to determine incident asthma between 31 and 46 years. Information regarding maternal smoking status was gathered at clinical visits via questionnaire at 6- and 7-months&#x02019; gestation. Association between the development of asthma and maternal smoking &#x00028;&#x0223C;1 cigarette or pipe per day&#x00029; was analyzed via Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003C7;<sup>2</sup> test. Maternal smoking and associated changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second &#x00028;FEV1&#x00029; and the FEV1 to forced vital capacity ratio were examined by using linear regression. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between maternal smoking status, adult-onset asthma, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms &#x00028;SNPs&#x00029;. Linear regression controlled for covariates including maternal education and parental asthma as well as offspring smoking status, education, ponderal index, parity, and Apgar score at first minute.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Maternal smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for the development of asthma in offspring between 31 and 46 years of age, and reduced offspring FEV1 to forced vital capacity ratio at 31 years of age. This association was more prominent in individuals with haplotype rs11702779-AA and with the subgroup that reported previous wheeze. No association was found between maternal smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy and offspring FEV1 at 31 years.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Gestational smoke exposure is associated with increased incidence of adult-onset asthma and reduced pulmonary function in adult offspring.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The results of this study are consistent with previous research revealing an association between gestational maternal smoke exposure and the subsequent development of asthma in offspring. This reveals susceptibility of the developing airway to maternal ETS exposure and the importance of smoking cessation during pregnancy. A limitation of this study is the inability to distinguish the role of prenatal maternal smoke exposure from maternal smoking in the home during the postnatal period.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GGG">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GGG</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Children born via cesarean delivery have higher rates of childhood asthma. In this study, researchers examined associations between mode of delivery and the gut microbiome and tested for relationships between these changes and asthma risk.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, 700 children enrolled in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort were included. Of these children, 151 were born via cesarean delivery, and 549 were born by vaginal delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this study, researchers used a nested case-control design. All children had at least 1 fecal sample collected before 1 year of age &#x00028;1 week, 1 month, and/or 1 year&#x00029;, analyzed by using 16S rRNA sequencing. A sparse partial least squares model was used to identify correlations between cesarean delivery and gut microbial composition at each time point. A &#x0201C;cesarean microbial score&#x0201D; was calculated for each time point, and a Kaplan-Meyer estimate was used to identify the cumulative asthma risk on the basis of delivery method and cesarean microbial score.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Cesarean delivery was associated with significant increases in asthma prevalence at age 6 &#x00028;odds ratio: 2.45&#x00029;. Cesarean delivery was also associated with marked differences in gut microbiota at 1 week and 1 month of age that became less significant by 1 year. The relationship between cesarean delivery and asthma depended on the microbiome composition at the age of 1 year. Of the children delivered by cesarean, only those who still had a significant cesarian microbiota signature at 1 year of age had higher rates of asthma at age 6 &#x00028;odds ratio: 1.37&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Cesarean delivery was associated with increased asthma risk but only in children who still had a cesarian gut microbial signature at 1 year of age.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>There is increasing evidence that early-life microbial exposures drive immune maturation and the risk of allergic diseases and asthma. With this study, the authors help to explain how delivery method influences asthma risk. In the results, it is indicated that cesarean delivery prevents the transfer of bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids in the gut to promote immune system regulation. With this observation, it is suggested that replacing these &#x0201C;missing bacteria&#x0201D; or their metabolites could reduce the risk for allergies and asthma in children born by cesarean delivery.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843HHH">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843HHH</ext-link>

</p></sec><sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: </title><p>Asthma is a common chronic disease of childhood in developed countries causing significant burden on public health. Rhinovirus is one of the most commonly identified triggers for wheezing episodes in preschool-aged children. In this study, researchers identified characteristics of children with preschool asthma associated with susceptibility to rhinovirus infections. The authors also investigated whether rhinovirus infections were associated with a more acute clinical course of asthma exacerbation and if rhinovirus infections were associated with a more compromised 12-month asthma course.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 130 children aged 4 to 6 years and who have a gestational age of at least 36 weeks. They had to have a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma by using Global Initiative for Asthma &#x00028;GINA&#x00029; criteria within the last 2 years. Patients were recruited from 5 centers in Europe. Subjects had to be asymptomatic for at least 4 to 6 weeks at baseline. Exclusion criteria included severe persistent asthma, concurrent immunotherapy treatment, and nonatopic chronic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A standardized questionnaire on symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, eczema, infections, immunizations, environmental factors, and family history was completed at study entry. Baseline blood tests and nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained. Daily medication and symptom diary was recorded. Subjects had 6-month follow-up visits for 2 years to review symptoms of asthma and rhinitis and collect nasopharyngeal samples. Guardians contacted the study center if subjects developed signs of a respiratory tract infection, had an exacerbation of asthma, had a noted decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second of &gt;15&#x00025; or peak flow of &gt;30&#x00025;, or had increase in symptom scores on diary of &#x02265;4. A clinic visit was then scheduled to obtain a nasopharyngeal sample to identify respiratory pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Among 130 study subjects, 62&#x00025; were boys, 55&#x00025; had aeroallergen sensitization, 38&#x00025; had active atopic dermatitis, and 38&#x00025; had vitamin D supplementation. A total of 59&#x00025; had mild persistent asthma, 25&#x00025; intermittent asthma, and 83&#x00025; had peak expiratory flows in the normal range. Of 571 visits, 54&#x00025; were positive for any virus, and rhinovirus was detected in 39&#x00025; of visits. Patient characteristics were only assessed with rhinovirus because of the low number of other respiratory viruses. The use of supplemental vitamin D was inversely associated with rhinovirus infection &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;. Rhinovirus was associated with more acute illness, including prolonged runny nose, severe night cough, and more sleep disturbance &#x00028;all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;. Rhinovirus infection was also analyzed for its impact on asthma activity for the following year. Rhinovirus infection was associated with an increase in asthma activity, with more night awakenings and more days of exercise triggered symptoms &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;. Increased rhinitis activity was also noted in the 12-months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Rhinovirus infection has both acute and long-term impact on preschool asthma stability. Vitamin D supplementation appears to modify rhinovirus infection and may have a protective effect against infection.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Rhinovirus infection has been a well-known trigger for asthma exacerbation, and the findings in this study are not surprising. Increasing asthma severity was noted for acute rhinovirus infection as well as for the 12-month period after rhinovirus infection. If vitamin D supplementation is truly protective against rhinovirus infection, than it may also have an impact on long-term control of childhood asthma. Controlled trials are required to confirm this prospective observation.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843III">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843III</ext-link>

</p></sec><sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate if proton pump inhibitor &#x00028;PPI&#x00029; use is associated with risk of asthma in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children and adolescents &#x02264;17 years included in several national registries in Sweden from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Data sources from this study included the following: &#x00028;1&#x00029; the National Patient Register, which contains complete records of disease diagnoses and surgical procedures from all inpatient and outpatient hospital and emergency department encounters; &#x00028;2&#x00029; the Prescribed Drug Register, which contains data on medications dispensed at all pharmacies in Sweden, and &#x00028;3&#x00029; the Total Population Register at Statistics Sweden, which provides details on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. From these sources, all children who initiated PPI use, defined as patients prescribed their first PPI during the study period and who had no PPI prescription in the year previous. Patients with history of asthma, defined as a diagnosis of asthma within 5 years before the index date or a prescription for an asthma medication within 1.5 years before the index date, were excluded. Those who initiated PPI use and those who did not were matched &#x00028;1:1 ratio&#x00029; on the basis of propensity score and age group to control for potential confounding. The primary outcome was incident asthma, defined as a first diagnosis of asthma &#x00028;primary or secondary diagnosis&#x00029; captured from hospital records and specialist outpatient care or &#x02265;2 independent prescriptions for any asthma medication filled within 90 days. The propensity score was derived by using multivariable logistic regression on the basis of several covariates including patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, comorbidities in the 2 years before the index date, and use of health care resources and comedications in the year before the index date.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Among the 80&#x02009;870 pairs &#x00028;63.0&#x00025; girls; mean age: 12.9 [SD: 4.8] years&#x00029;, those who initiated PPI use had a higher incidence rate of asthma &#x00028;21.8 events per 1000 person-years&#x00029;, compared with those who did not initiate PPIs &#x00028;14.0 events per 1000 person-years&#x00029;, with a hazard ratio &#x00028;HR&#x00029; of 1.57 &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 1.64&#x00029;. The risk of asthma was significantly increased across all age groups and was the highest for infants and toddlers with an HR of 1.83 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.65 to 2.03&#x00029; in the group &lt;6 months of age and 1.91 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.65 to 2.22&#x00029; in the 6 months to &lt;2 years of age group &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for interaction&#x00029;. The association was consistent through all sensitivity analyses, including high-dimensional propensity score matching &#x00028;HR: 1.48 [95&#x00025; CI: 1.41 to 1.55]&#x00029;. In addition, the association between initiation of PPI use and risk of asthma was significantly different in subgroup analyses, according to history of atopic disease &#x00028;HR for history: 1.22 [95&#x00025; CI: 1.04 to 1.43]; HR for no history: 1.60 [95&#x00025; CI: 1.52 to 1.68]; <italic>P</italic> = .001 for interaction&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Using data from a national registry in Sweden, the authors of this study report an 57&#x00025; increased risk of asthma among children &#x00028;across all age groups&#x00029; who initiated PPI uses, compared with that of those who did not.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors add to a growing body of literature in both pregnant women and young infants that questions the safety of PPI use. Specifically, it is one of the first in which researchers look at PPI use and risk of asthma across all age groups, not just infants and toddlers. It is interesting to note that those without a history of atopy had higher HR to developing asthma, possibly identifying that PPI-mediated interference in the balance between the symbiotic and pathologic microbial species may cause asthma in those without genetic predispositions. Notably, however, data using large registries can only identify possible associations and further studies that can confirm asthma diagnosis, severity, PPI use, indication for use as well as several other important covariates would be needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843JJJ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843JJJ</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the association between adverse childhood experiences &#x00028;ACEs&#x00029; and childhood asthma. In the study, the researchers also examined the effect of race and ethnicity and sex on asthma in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 49&#x02009;000 children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. Within the population, 51.1&#x00025; were male, and 11.5&#x00025; had asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>ACEs were identified from parental report in the 2017&#x02013;2018 National Survey of Children&#x02019;s Health. Examples of ACEs included exposure to poverty, parental separation, parental death, incarceration, domestic abuse, neighborhood violence, alcohol and drug use, mental illness, and discrimination. The subjects were separated into 4 groups on the basis of cumulative ACE count: 0, 1, 2, and &#x02265;3. The outcome variable was childhood asthma on the basis of parental report in the National Survey of Children&#x02019;s Health. The association between ACEs and childhood asthma was examined while adjusting for confounding variables.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>On the basis of parental report, 42&#x00025; of children with asthma had at least 1 ACE, with 9.7&#x00025; having &#x02265;3 ACEs. Compared with children without ACEs, children exposed to &#x02265;3 ACEs had an increased odds of having asthma &#x00028;adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.45; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.15 to 1.83&#x00029;. In addition, non-Hispanic Black boys &#x00028;aOR: 1.84; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.43 to 2.36&#x00029; and non-Hispanic Black girls &#x00028;aOR: 1.38, 95&#x00025; CI: 1.08&#x02013;1.77&#x00029; had increased odds of childhood asthma, when compared with non-Hispanic White boys.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In the study, the researchers identified an association between ACEs and childhood asthma, especially in children with cumulative ACE exposure &#x00028;&#x02265;3 ACEs&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>ACEs can lead to short-term and long-term health consequences. In this study, the authors establish a link between ACE exposure and childhood asthma. Better understanding of these interactions could reduce health disparities by facilitating early recognition of children at high-risk for developing asthma. In this study, the authors highlight the need for additional research to understand the biological mechanisms linking ACEs to asthma development.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KKK">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KKK</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To identify risk factors &#x00028;air pollution and family related&#x00029; for the onset of asthma and persistent wheezing in children.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>All Danish children born from 1997 to 2014 who were managed for asthma onset and persistent wheezing from the age of 1 year to 15 years by using a national registry based, matched case-control design.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Children were managed in the Danish National Patient Register for the classification of asthma or persistent wheezing after hospital discharge, or with a minimum of 2 prescriptions for asthma medications. Information regarding concentration of air pollutants &#x00028;several gases, aerosols, particular matter &lt;2.5&#x000B5;m [PM<sub>2.5</sub>] and particular matter &lt;10&#x000B5;m&#x00029;, parental asthma diagnoses and asthma medication prescriptions, maternal smoking habits, highest completed parental education, and parental income levels were collected and analyzed for hazard ratios &#x00028;HRs&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>From 1997&#x02013;2014, 3&#x02009;192&#x02009;785 children were included in the study, and 122&#x02009;842 &#x00028;3.84&#x00025;&#x00029; children developed asthma and/or persistent wheezing, with a mean age of development of 1.9 years. Maternal asthma had a higher risk than paternal asthma &#x00028;adjusted HR&#x00029;: 1.72 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.72 to 1.77&#x00029; vs 1.51 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.48 to 1.53&#x00029;], but having 2 parents with asthma was associated with a 2.40-fold &#x00028;2.34-fold to 2.47-fold&#x00029; risk of childhood asthma. Maternal smoking during pregnancy &#x00028;adjusted HR: 1.23 [1.18 to 1.28]&#x00029; or quitting during pregnancy &#x00028;HR: 1.20 [1.18 to 1.22]&#x00029; increased the risk of childhood asthma. Exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particular matter &lt;10&#x000B5;m, and nitrogen dioxide were also associated with development of asthma, with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure being the most consistent. Higher parental income levels, together and independently, had a reduced risk for childhood asthma &#x00028;adjusted HR: 0.85 [95&#x00025; CI: 0.81 to 0.89&#x00029; for the highest parental income level, compared with 1.04 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 1.00 to 1.08&#x00029; for the lowest parental income level]. Higher parental education levels, together and independently, had a reduced risk for childhood asthma &#x00028;adjusted HR: 0.72 [95&#x00025; CI: 0.69 to 0.75]&#x00029; for the highest parental education level, compared with 0.98 [95&#x00025; CI: 0.95 to 1.00] for the lowest parental education level&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Parental history of asthma, higher levels of exposure to PM<sub>2.5,</sub> and maternal smoking during pregnancy all increase a child&#x02019;s risk of developing asthma and persistent wheezing. High levels of parental educational attainment and income are associated with a lower risk of developing asthma and persistent wheezing in children.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Strengths of this study include the use of a large database that covered 18 years. In this study, researchers did not analyze atopy, lung function, or inflammatory markers. A family history of asthma, tobacco exposure and environmental pollutants were confirmed as risk factors for asthma development. Smoking cessation campaigns and environmental strategies to decrease particulate matter exposure may reduce the number of children who develop asthma.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LLL">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LLL</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>In few studies have researchers characterized the relationship between the frequency &#x00028;and severity&#x00029; of early events and long-term disease evolution in preschoolers with asthma. The purpose of this study was to investigate if asthma control trajectories 2 years postdiagnosis in preschoolers were associated with subsequent disease remission and recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study included a population cohort in 4 Canadian provinces consisting of 48&#x02009;687 children with asthma diagnosed before 5 years of age and born between 1990 and 2013 who had prolonged disease activity postdiagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Prolonged disease activity was defined as &#x02265;1 medical visits or medications for asthma every 6-month period for at least 4 of the 6 periods postdiagnosis. Remission was defined as 2 consecutive years without drug claims or medical visits for asthma. Asthma control trajectories were classified by using the validated Pharmacoepidemiologic Pediatric Asthma Control Index. Cox regression models within each Canadian province were used to estimate associations between asthma control trajectories and time to remission or recurrence, with children controlled 2 years postdiagnosis as a reference control category. Province specific hazard ratios &#x00028;HRs&#x00029; and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals &#x00028;CIs&#x00029; were summarized by using random-effects meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>All suboptimal control trajectories were associated with a lower likelihood of remission, compared with that of children who were controlled throughout, with a pooled adjusted HR for remission of 0.51 &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 0.45 to 0.59&#x00029; for those out of control throughout. An older age at diagnosis, atopy, and asthma diagnosis on the basis of hospitalization outside of the winter season were associated with a lower likelihood of remission. Suboptimal control trajectories were also associated with a higher likelihood of recurrence &#x00028;HR: 1.17; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.11 to 1.24&#x00029;, compared with children controlled throughout. Stratifying by sex or atopy did not significantly alter estimated HRs between trajectories. Girls in the study had higher recurrence rates than boys did. Children without atopy in early life were more likely to experience recurrence, compared with atopic children.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In the 2 years after an asthma diagnosis in preschoolers, worse asthma control trajectories were associated with incrementally lower likelihoods of remission.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors are the first to investigate the association between asthma control trajectories after a preschool diagnosis and remission. The asthma control trajectory in the 2 years after diagnosis in preschoolers appears to be an important predictor of both remission and recurrence, with poorer control associated with a lower likelihood of remission. With the study, the authors support previous studies in which researchers reported potential predictors of persistence, including older age at diagnosis, male sex, and diagnosis in a season other than winter.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MMM">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MMM</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the relationship between the low percentage of expiratory time necessary to reach tidal expiratory flow &#x00028;tPTEF/tE&#x00029; and flow at the end tidal point &#x00028;VmaxFRC&#x00029; in early infancy to the development of asthma, airflow limitation, and airway structural abnormalities in this 36-year birth cohort of the Tucson Children&#x02019;s Respiratory Study.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This is a birth cohort consisting of 1246 healthy infants born between 1980 to 1984 enrolled in the TCRS. Only 180 infants &lt;6 months of age were tested by using the chest compression technique for pulmonary function testing because this technique was not developed until the end of the enrollment period.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Demographic information was obtained via parent completed questionnaires. Infant lung function testing included tidal breathing indices, functional residual capacity via a helium-dilutions-gas-equilibration method, and partial expiratory-flow curves, from which the tPTEF/tE was determined. VmaxFRC was determined via partial expiratory flow-volume curves by using the chest compression technique. Active asthma was defined as a physician diagnosis of asthma at any age, with active symptoms within the previous year based on questionnaires obtained every 2 to 4 years between the ages of 6 and 36 years. Survey information, spirometry &#x00028;prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator and full lung volumes&#x00029;, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest was completed at the age of 26 years. Data were analyzed via multivariate linear regression models and generalized estimating equations.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 180 infants, who underwent pulmonary function testing, were compared with 1066 participants who did not undergo testing. The tested cohort revealed 8&#x00025; with active asthma at the age of 6 years and 18&#x00025; at the age of 36 years. Levels of infant tPTEF/tE and VmaxFRC were lower for participants who developed active asthma. tPTEF/tE and VmaxFRC were associated with a significant risk for active asthma &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .003 and <italic>P</italic> =.007, respectively&#x00029; and those in the lowest tertile of both indices were at highest risk &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .009 and <italic>P</italic> = .01, respectively&#x00029;. Both tPTEF/tE and VmaxFRC were associated with an increased odds of developing active asthma between the ages of 6 and 36 years &#x00028;70&#x00025; [<italic>P</italic> = .001] and 55&#x00025; [<italic>P</italic> = .005], respectively&#x00029;. At the age of 26 years, low infant tPTEF/tE was associated with reductions in airway diameter, total area, and luminal and wall areas, whereas VmaxFRC was associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow 25&#x00025; to 75&#x00025; levels.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Reduced tPTEF/tE and VmaxFRC levels in infancy may indicate an increased risk for active asthma by the age of 36 years on the basis of pulmonary function testing and airway imaging in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Recognizing risk factors for asthma may extend beyond family history and personal history of atopy and respiratory infections. This study reveals that airflow limitation early in infancy may help predict asthma later in life and warrants further studies to standardize methods for clinical use and application. Understanding the time course of asthma development is essential in prevention and treatment.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NNN">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NNN</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>With improved neonatal intensive care, more children born before 26 weeks&#x02019; gestation &#x00028;extremely preterm [EP]&#x00029; survive to adulthood. What is the pulmonary status of these patients?</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 123 19-year-olds born EP. A total of 64 age and sex matched subjects born at term served as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Subjects were interviewed regarding health status. Spirometry &#x00028;with bronchodilator&#x00029; and a standardized incremental shuttle walk test were performed. These studies were also compared with those done on the same participants when they were 11 years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Compared with the control group, the EP group was significantly impaired on all spirometric parameters. The difference in mean postbronchodilator forced vital capacity <italic>z</italic> score between EP and control subjects was &#x02212;0.64 SD &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: &#x02212;0.94 to &#x02212;0.35&#x00029;, equivalent to 470 mL, and the mean difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 second <italic>z</italic> scores was &#x02212;1.08 SD &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;1.40 to &#x02212;0.77&#x00029;, equivalent to 600 mL. Bronchodilator reversibility &#x00028;defined as a &gt;12&#x00025; change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#x00029; was more common in the EP group &#x00028;26.5&#x00025;&#x00029; than it was in the control group &#x00028;6.3&#x00025;; odds ratio: 5.39 [95&#x00025; CI: 1.81 to 16.04]&#x00029;. Although the EP group was not more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of asthma by the participants usual clinician, as reported by the participant &#x00028;41&#x00025; versus 34&#x00025;&#x00029;, those EP participants who had had neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia &#x00028;BPD&#x00029; were more likely to have this diagnosis than those EP participants who had not &#x00028;49&#x00025; versus 21&#x00025;&#x00029;. Comparing spirometry at age 11 and age 19 revealed no evidence of &#x0201C;catch up&#x0201D; improvement in lung function. A clinically and statistically significant lower shuttle walk distance was observed in the EP group, compared with the control group &#x00028;899 m [SD: 305] vs 1132 m [SD: 303]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;, and in the EP group with BPD, compared with the EP group without BPD &#x00028;862 m [SD: 304] vs 991 m [SD: 290]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>EP survivors have lower lung function and decreased exercise capacity, as compared with that of controls. EP survivors who had neonatal BPD had higher rates of reported physician-diagnosed asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>When evaluating adults with asthma, it is appropriate to inquire about neonatal history, given these profound, long-term consequences on lung function and exercise capacity and be particularly attentive because the authors point out to &#x0201C;promotion of a healthy lifestyle, including, for example, physical activity, weight management, and tobacco avoidance.&#x0201D;</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OOO">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OOO</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Early allergic disease manifestations in infants may influence breastfeeding practices. In the current study, researchers sought to examine the relationship between breastfeeding duration and the development of asthma and allergic asthma phenotypes, stratified by a diagnosis of eczema during or after breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children who participated in the 6 year follow-up of the HealthNuts study, a population-based, longitudinal cohort study of allergic diseases in Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Children were enrolled between the ages of 11 and 15 months, and data regarding breastfeeding history, eczema diagnosis, environmental exposures, and family history of allergic disease were collected via questionnaire. At 6 years, information on wheeze, medication use, and parental report of physician-diagnosed asthma were obtained. Skin-prick testing to foods and aeroallergens at the age of 6 helped to stratify children with asthma into allergic and nonallergic phenotypes. From an original cohort of 5276 children, 3663 had completed questionnaires at 6 years, 3111 underwent skin testing, and 3632 had asthma data available for analysis. Children were characterized as never or ever breastfed. Of those breastfed, exclusive breastfeeding was categorized as never, &lt;6 months, or &gt;6 months. The overall duration of breastfeeding was treated as both a continuous &#x00028;number of months&#x00029; and categorical variable &#x00028;&lt;3 months, 3 to &lt;6 months, 6 to &lt;12 months, or &gt;12 months&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Children who did not participate in the full questionnaire at the age of 6 were more likely to be never breastfed, from a lower socioeconomic background, have one or both parents born outside of Australia, have no family history of allergic disease, and have had exposure to prenatal maternal or environmental smoking. Among children with asthma data, 96&#x00025; were breastfed. At the age of 6, the prevalence of current asthma was 13&#x00025;. Children with asthma were more likely to be male, have a parental history of asthma, have a family history of allergic disease, have been born preterm, have been born via cesarean delivery, and have been exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Breastfeeding initiation was not associated with current asthma at the age of 6 years &#x00028;adjusted odds ratio: 0.76&#x00029; when compared with never breastfeeding. An increased duration of breastfeeding in children without eczema in infancy was associated with a reduced odds of asthma &#x00028;per month increase; adjusted odds ratio: 0.98&#x00029;, which equates to a 0.86 reduced odds of asthma for a 6 month increase in breastfeeding. This association was not apparent in children who were diagnosed with eczema during breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>A longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with a reduced odds of asthma at the age pf 6 years among children without history of eczema in the first year. This association was masked before stratification of patients by history of eczema in infancy.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Breastfeeding is known to be beneficial for improving many health outcomes. However, previous studies have not clearly demonstrated protective effects for breastfeeding on asthma. In the current study, a modest protective association was observed between an increased duration of breastfeeding and asthma but only among children who were not diagnosed with eczema in their first year. This association is complex because infantile eczema is a known risk factor for asthma and has also been shown to influence breastfeeding choices. Additional study is needed on the interplay between breastfeeding practices, early allergic manifestations, and the risk of subsequent allergic outcomes.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PPP">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PPP</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To explore the association between longitudinal changes in early nasal microbiota and the risk of developing asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 704 children &#x00028;aged 0 to 7 years old&#x00029; born in the Hospital District of Southwest Finland between January 2008 and April 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a prospective, population-based birth cohort study. Children with a qualified baseline nasal microbiota sample at 2 months old and at least 1 follow-up sample were included in the analysis. Samples were collected by using nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The nasal microbiota were tested by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. An unsupervised machine learning approach was used to identify mutually exclusive, longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles. Changes in profiles between the ages of 2 to 13 months and 2 to 24 months were examined. The profile with persistent <italic>Moraxella</italic> dominance was used as the reference group because this was the largest group, a finding also supported by the literature. The primary outcome was the risk of physician-diagnosed asthma at the ages of 6.5 to 7.5 years old. The secondary outcome was the number of acute respiratory infections &#x00028;ARIs&#x00029; during 13 to 24 months of age. The association of the microbiota longitudinal profiles with the risk of developing asthma and rate of ARIs was measured by using multivariable logistic regression and negative binomial models.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS: </title><p>Of the 704 children in the analytic cohort, 57 &#x00028;8&#x00025;&#x00029; developed asthma. Across all samples, the nasal airway microbiota was dominated by <italic>Moraxella</italic>, which generally increased with age. During age 2 to 13 months, 4 distinct longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles were identified: &#x00028;1&#x00029; persistent <italic>Moraxella</italic><italic> </italic>dominance profile &#x00028;reference group&#x00029;, &#x00028;2&#x00029; <italic>Streptococcus</italic> to <italic>Moraxella</italic> transition profile, &#x00028;3&#x00029; persistent <italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> and <italic>Corynebacteriaceae</italic> dominance profile, and &#x00028;4&#x00029; persistent <italic>Moraxella</italic> sparsity profile. During 2 to 24 months of age, an additional distinct longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles was identified: &#x00028;5&#x00029; a mixed longitudinal pattern profile. Overall, children with a persistent <italic>Moraxella</italic> sparsity profile were at a significantly higher risk of developing asthma &#x00028;adjusted odds ratio: 2.74; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.20 to 6.27 for those in this profile at 2 to 13 months of age, which persisted in the 2 to 24 month profile&#x00029; and had significantly higher incidence rates of ARIs &#x00028;incidence rate ratio: 1.16; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.32, from 13 to 24 months of age&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this study, researchers found that, compared with the reference group &#x00028;<italic>Moraxella</italic> dominant profile&#x00029;, children with an altered longitudinal nasal microbiota pattern &#x00028;<italic>Moraxella</italic> sparsity profile&#x00029; during early childhood had a higher risk of developing asthma and ARIs.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This is the first study to reveal an association between longitudinal changes in early airway microbiota and later development of childhood asthma.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To identify the measurable physiologic changes in the small airways of children with asthma, when employing a 2.5 &#x000B5;m particulate matter &#x00028;PM<sub>2.5</sub>&#x00029; filtration device in their bedrooms.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The population enrolled includes children with mild or moderate asthma who live in a suburb of Shanghai, China, during a low-ozone season. A total of 43 children &#x00028;5&#x02013;13 years old; 60&#x00025; boys&#x00029; are included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patients are randomly assigned into either arm of a double-blind crossover study design with 3 consecutive 14 day periods of true filtration-washout-sham filtration or the reverse order. Impulse oscillometry, spirometry, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide &#x00028;FeNO&#x00029; were measured before and after each intervention, and peak flow was measured twice per day at home.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were moderately high &#x00028;28.6-69.8 <inline-formula xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:m="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math">

</inline-formula>g/m<sup>3</sup>&#x00029; among the enrollees. A decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration by 63.4&#x00025; was noted in true filtration bedrooms, when compared with sham filtration. True filtration was associated with improved airway mechanics, as measured by impulse oscillometry &#x00028;a 22&#x00025; to 43&#x00025; decrease in resonant frequency, small airway resistance, and total airway resistance and 73&#x00025; increase in airway reactance&#x00029;, FeNO, &#x00028;27.6&#x00025; decrease&#x00029; and peak flow measurement &#x00028;1.6&#x00025; increase&#x00029;. These airway parameters were significantly associated with bedroom particulate matter reduction. Statistical significance was only noted in children without eosinophilic airway inflammation at the baseline &#x00028;an absolute eosinophil count of 450 cells per &#x003BC;L and FeNO &gt;35 parts per billion&#x00029;. No large airway parameters &#x00028;forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity&#x00029; differed after 14 days of true filtration.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> filtration in the bedroom may improve airway mechanics and inflammation in pediatric patients with asthma who do not have eosinophilic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors expand on previous work by the same group that revealed 1 night of HEPA air filtration improved airway mechanics in healthy adults. The results after 2 weeks indicate a promising intervention for children with noneosinophilic asthma. The authors carefully controlled for a number of confounders, including intercurrent illness, asthma exacerbations, seasonal variation, ozone levels, inhaled corticosteroid use, and secondhand smoke exposure. In future studies, researchers should address patients in different environmental conditions with a larger sample size, for a longer intervention period, before formal recommendations can be made.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RRR">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RRR</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate relationships between inner-city classroom NO<sub>2</sub> exposure and asthma symptoms and morbidity by BMI category.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged 4 to 13 &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 271&#x00029; years from 37 inner-city schools who had physician-diagnosed asthma for at least 1 year and were using daily preventive asthma medication, had wheezing within the last year, and/or had at least 1 unscheduled health care visit for asthma within the past year.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a single-center prospective study conducted within the School Inner-City Asthma Study. Before the start of the academic year, baseline demographics, environmental factors, and asthma symptoms and medication use were obtained by questionnaire. Baseline evaluations included skin testing to common seasonal and perennial aeroallergens or by assessment serum-specific IgE to the same allergens, spirometry, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide &#x00028;FeNO&#x00029; measurement. BMI percentile was calculated and categorized by using CDC classifications. Classroom NO<sub>2</sub> was measured twice during the school year, &#x0223C;6 months apart. The primary outcome was the number of days with asthma symptoms within the previous 14 days. The secondary outcomes assessed in the previous 2 weeks were the number of exacerbations &#x00028;hospitalizations or unscheduled health care visits for asthma&#x00029;, the number of days caretakers had to change plans because of the child&#x02019;s asthma symptoms, FeNO level, and pulmonary function &#x00028;forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Participants were predominantly African American and Hispanic &#x00028;35&#x00025; each&#x00029; and impoverished &#x00028;49&#x00025; had an annual household income &lt;&#x00024;25&#x02009;000&#x00029;. A total of 50&#x00025; had normal BMI &#x00028;fifth percentile to &lt;85th percentile&#x00029;, 15&#x00025; were overweight &#x00028;85th percentile to &lt;95&#x00025; percentile&#x00029;, and 35&#x00025; were obese &#x00028;&#x02265;95th percentile&#x00029;. Most &#x00028;69&#x00025;&#x00029; were atopic, with specific immunoglobulin E to at least 1 aeroallergen. Obese students with asthma had statistically &#x00028;but likely not clinically relevant&#x00029; lower pulmonary function &#x00028;FEV1 and FVC but not FEV1/FVC ratio&#x00029;, more positive skin test results, and lower FeNO than students with normal weight. The BMI category did not affect asthma symptom days, asthma symptoms, medication use, health care use for asthma, or missed school days. Caretakers of children with normal weight changed their plans more often than those of students who were overweight or obese. For children with normal weight or those who were overweight, NO<sub>2</sub> levels were not associated with any of the measured outcomes. However, among children who were obese, for every 10-fold increase in NO<sub>2</sub> level there were increased odds of asthma symptom days &#x00028;1.9-fold&#x00029;, acute asthma-related health care use &#x00028;2.4-fold&#x00029;, a missed school day because of asthma &#x00028;3.1-fold&#x00029;, and care takers&#x02019; plans being changed because of the child&#x02019;s asthma &#x00028;4.2-fold&#x00029;. As compared with children with normal weight, in students who were obese, every 10 parts per billion increase in classroom NO<sub>2</sub> level increased the likelihood of an asthma symptom day &#x00028;odds ratio: 1.86; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.15 to 3.02&#x00029; and of care takers changing their plans &#x00028;odds ratio: 4.24; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 2.33 to 7.70&#x00029;. NO<sub>2</sub> levels did not affect other outcomes, lung function, or FeNO across BMI categories.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Obesity in inner-city students with asthma appears to increase susceptibility to the adverse effects of classroom NO<sub>2.</sub>
</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS: </title><p>NO<sub>2</sub> is formed by combustion of liquid or solid fossil fuels. Indoor sources include gas stoves, heaters, and poorly ventilated furnaces and fireplaces. Furthermore, outdoor levels are elevated in heavily trafficked urban areas. The Environmental Protection Agency&#x02019;s standard for safe outdoor level of NO<sub>2</sub> is &#x0223C;50 parts per billion over a 1-year averaging time and 100 parts per billion over a 1 hour averaging time. Although the authors of this study do not specifically report classroom NO<sub>2</sub> levels, it is clear from the 2 figures in the article that levels did not exceed 30 parts per billion, hence they were nowhere near the level up to which the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. This is a warning that &#x0201C;safe&#x0201D; might not be safe enough. I think we all recognize the multiple and varied effects that both pollution and obesity have on health. With this study, the authors suggest synergy between 2 health risk factors and indicate that, as physicians, we must address all known risk factors for disease as we provide the best preventive and prospective care we can.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SSS">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SSS</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate whether the frequency of asthma-related emergency department &#x00028;ED&#x00029; visits could predict future asthma hospitalization in the pediatric population.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study included 2669 children between the ages of 2 and 16.99 years with asthma visits to the ED at the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario between September 2012 to August 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective cohort study in which health administrative data were used to identify all pediatric asthma visits to the ED from 2012 to 2015. The first asthma ED visit within the 3-year inclusion period was defined as index ED visit. The primary exposure was the number of asthma ED visits in the preceding 12 months. Each patient was managed for 12 months after the index ED visit to identify the number of asthma-related hospitalizations and subsequent ED visits. The severity of asthma symptoms at each visit was assessed by using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The number of asthma ED visits in the preceding year was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in the subsequent 12 months in a dose-dependent manner. The risk of hospitalization was 2.9 &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.6 to 5&#x00029; times higher in children with 1 previous ED visit and 4.4 &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.9 to 10.4&#x00029; times higher in children with &#x02265;2 previous ED visits, compared with that of children with no ED visits. Asthma severity on the basis of Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale level was also a risk factor for future asthma hospitalization. The number of previous asthma ED visits was associated with an increased risk of repeat asthma ED visits in the following year.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The number of asthma ED visits was identified as an independent marker of future asthma-related hospitalizations and repeat ED visits in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>A major goal of asthma management is to reduce the risk of exacerbations leading to ED visits and hospitalization. Poor asthma control leads to school absenteeism and increased health care use. Identification of a reliable marker to predict future asthma risk could help health care providers target interventions to children at high risk. In this study, the authors identified ED visit count as a predictor of future asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric patients.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TTT">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TTT</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if bitter taste or n-propylthiouracil sensitivity is altered in patients with asthma and whether it correlates with disease characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION: </title><p>A total of 65 adults with confirmed asthma and 62 age- and sex-matched controls without asthma were studied. Exclusion criteria included but were not limited to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease &#x00028;COPD&#x00029;, &gt;10 pack-years smoking history, and other conditions associated with dysgeusia.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patients rated their ability to smell and taste on a 10 cm visual analog scale. Asthma severity and medication step were assessed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma &#x00028;GINA&#x00029; guidelines. Gustatory sensitivity for sweet, sour, bitter salty, and umami &#x00028;corresponding with monosodium glutamate taste&#x00029; was assessed as perceived or not perceived by using a &#x0201C;Test Sprays&#x0201D; test and taste threshold assessed by using the &#x0201C;Taste Strips&#x0201D; test &#x00028;TST&#x00029;. The TST measured each taste on a 0 to 4 point scale &#x00028;cumulative score: 0&#x02013;20&#x00029;. As another assessment of bitter perception, an impregnated test strip, was used to identify n-propylthiouracil &#x0201C;tasters&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;nontasters&#x0201D;</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Patients with asthma had significantly lower sensitivity for bitter &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .026&#x00029;, salty &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .035&#x00029;, umami &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and n-propylthiouracil &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029; than controls did. TST scores of 0 to 1 for individual tastes were more common in asthma patients, whereas scores of 3 to 4 were more common in controls without asthma. Taking medications with possible gustatory side effects &#x00028;eg, cetirizine or formoterol&#x00029; did not affect the results in the patients with asthma but had a moderate effect on salty and cumulative TST in the control group &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>P</italic> = .01, respectively&#x00029;. Among the asthma patients, asthma severity was negatively correlated with the bitter TST &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = &#x02212;.28&#x00029; and cumulative TST &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = &#x02212;.37&#x00029; scores. Similarly, the GINA treatment step was negatively correlated with the cumulative TST score &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = &#x02212;.026&#x00029; and bitter TST score &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = &#x02212;.30&#x00029;. No other correlations between asthma severity or medication requirement and tastes were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>There is a diminished gustatory sensitivity to bitter and n-propylthiouracil in patients with asthma that correlates with asthma severity. A simple n-propylthiouracil or quinine taste test may be a prognostic test to predict asthma severity.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>My first thought when I read this article was, &#x0201C;Who even knew there were taste receptors on airway smooth muscle and who thought to look in the first place?&#x0201D; Taste receptors &#x00028;TAS2Rs&#x00029; in human airway smooth muscle result in bronchodilation when activated. TAS2R polymorphisms are associated with more severe asthma. Increased expression of leukocyte TAS2Rs correlates with asthma severity in adults and children. The overexpression of TAS2Rs may be physiologic compensation for diminished functionality. With this study, the authors tell us 1 more thing that we did not know about asthma. There is much more yet to learn, including things we have not even considered. Unfortunately, we do not even know what we do not know&#x00021;</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UUU">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UUU</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: </title><p>This study was aimed at improving inpatient asthma care in the pediatric population through the implementation of visual evidence-based guidelines, called pathways, in diverse hospital settings.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Pediatric patients &#x00028;ages 2&#x02013;17&#x00029; hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of asthma in diverse hospital settings across the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>From January 2018 through March 2019, clinicians from &gt;250 hospitals that varied in size, location &#x00028;urban versus rural&#x00029;, ownership &#x00028;private versus nonprofit&#x00029;, and type &#x00028;community versus children&#x02019;s&#x00029; were recruited to participate in the study. Clinicians were identified through the Value in Inpatient Pediatrics electronic mailing list. Participating hospitals were given evidence-based pathways and order sets as well as various support services for pathway implementation &#x00028;educational seminars, quality improvement training, and monthly video conferences&#x00029;. Data on hospital characteristics were collected through a survey of implementation leaders. Outcomes data were collected via chart review. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay &#x00028;LOS&#x00029;, and secondary outcomes included early administration of bronchodilator via metered-dose inhaler &#x00028;MDI&#x00029;, screening for secondhand tobacco smoke exposure, referral of caregivers to smoking cessation resources, hospital readmission within 7 days of discharge, and emergency department revisits within 7 days of discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 85 hospitals were enrolled in the study, and 68 hospitals completed the study &#x00028;participated for the full 15-month duration&#x00029;. There was diversity in the types of hospitals that completed the study in terms of size, type, and location. Pathway implementation was not associated with significant changes in LOS, but it was associated with statistically significant increases in early administration of bronchodilators versus MDI as well as caretaker referral to smoking cessation resources. Specific interventions, including implementation of MDI dosing guidance and reminders for smoking cessation resources, were associated with improvements in early administration of MDI and referral to smoking cessation resources, respectively. These improvements were noted with pathway initiation and not just study enrollment. Hospital level analysis revealed that most hospitals &#x00028;65&#x00025;&#x00029; had significant improvements in &gt;1 outcome. Only 2 hospitals had increases in 7-day hospital readmission or emergency department revisits &#x00028;balancing measures&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Overall, pathway implementation was not associated with statistically significant changes in LOS but was associated with improvements in the quality of care being provided, specifically in increasing early administration of bronchodilators via MDI and referring caretakers to smoking cessation resources.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Childhood asthma is a major cause of pediatric hospitalization and associated health care costs. Pathways or evidence-based visual guidelines for the treatment of asthma have previously been shown to improve the quality of care of pediatric asthma patients. Large-scale quality improvement projects are extremely difficult to implement because of variations at each site. However, standardization of care can be attained through automated measures, particularly within the electronic medical record. Similar to other large-scale projects across multiple sites, this project did not move the needle overall for their predetermined primary outcome measure, but it did reveal that pathways helped improve other quality care measures, such as early MDI use and provision of smoking cessation resources. Additionally, this study reveals that use of pathways may be beneficial across a diverse array of hospitals, not just large, tertiary care children&#x02019;s hospitals.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VVV">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VVV</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF STUDY:</title><p>In this quasi-experimental quality improvement study, researchers examined the effects of clinical pathway implementation on pediatric asthma care in a diverse, national sample of emergency departments &#x00028;EDs&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 83 EDs &#x00028;37 children&#x02019;s hospitals and 46 community sites&#x00029; were enrolled in this study, and 61 participated for the full 15-month study period. These EDs varied in size, location, geography, and ownership. A total of 22&#x02009;963 children aged 2 to 17 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma were evaluated, with 12&#x02009;870 treated before and 10&#x02009;093 treated after pathway implementation. The 2 groups did not differ significantly by age, sex, inhaled steroid use, or insurance type.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Each ED received a pathway implementation toolkit including sample evidence-based pathways and order sets. Educational materials included asthma severity tools, chest radiograph ordering criteria, and indications for administering corticosteroids. Participating EDs were also provided additional quality improvement training, educational seminars, a mobile application to view pathway content, and feedback sessions. Before pathway implementation, data on patient encounters were collected retrospectively from chart review. During the pathway implementation period, data were prospectively collected.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Pathway implementation was associated with an increased odds of systemic corticosteroid administration within the first hour of ED arrival &#x00028;odds ratio [OR]: 1.26; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.55&#x00029; and increased odds of asthma severity assessment at triage &#x00028;OR: 1.26; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.22 to 1.90&#x00029;. Data also revealed a weak but statistically significant decrease in odds of hospital admission &#x00028;OR: 0.97; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.95 to 0.99&#x00029;. This represents an overall 1&#x00025; decrease in hospital admissions and/or ED transfers. There was no change observed in the use of chest radiographs or ED length of stay.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Overall, this study revealed that clinical pathway implementation can improve adherence to guideline-directed management by increasing the rate of asthma severity assessment and improve patient outcomes by decreasing time to corticosteroid administration across a diverse array of ED settings. Although this study revealed a statistically significant decrease &#x00028;1&#x00025;&#x00029; in hospital admission and/or ED transfer on aggregate, the data reveal a highly variable impact on individual EDs.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Previous single-site studies have revealed that pathway implementation and targeted education measures can improve quality of pediatric asthma care. This study, which included both academic and community EDs, is the first to reveal the generalizability of pathway implementation on asthma management. Further studies are needed to determine which specific pathway components are most impactful in improving pediatric asthma care in the ED setting.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WWW">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WWW</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess whether sensor-based monitoring of daily inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting b-agonist medications can improve asthma outcomes in diverse populations</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A socioeconomically and racially diverse population of caregiver and children dyads were randomly assigned to control &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 127&#x00029; or sensor-based electronic monitoring &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 125&#x00029; for asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a randomized controlled multicenter trial of socioeconomically and racially diverse caregiver and children pairs from 5 Chicago medical clinics. The primary outcomes measured were the Asthma Control Test &#x00028;ACT&#x00029; &#x00028;&#x02265;19 score equivalent to controlled asthma&#x00029; and health care use &#x00028;emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and oral corticosteroid prescriptions&#x00029;. Caregiver quality of life &#x00028;QoL&#x00029; and adherence to inhaled corticosteroids were also evaluated with multitiered models to ascertain changes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The intervention group had a significant increase in adjusted mean ACT scores &#x00028;19.1 [<italic>n</italic> = 123; SE = 0.3] to 21.8 [<italic>n</italic> = 102; SE = 0.4]&#x00029;. The control group also had an increase in adjusted mean ACT scores &#x00028;19.4 [<italic>n</italic> = 126; SE = 0.3] to 19.9 [<italic>n</italic> = 118; SE = 0.4]&#x00029;, the change was less than that of the intervention group at all time points &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 for all comparisons&#x00029;. There was no difference in terms of the reported number of asthma attacks, missed school days, and steroid prescriptions in the ED and/or hospital. However, more children in the intervention group were prescribed steroids for asthma attacks during the 12 month study than controls were &#x00028;72.5&#x00025; intervention versus 34.6&#x00025; control; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01&#x00029;. Improved QoL was reported by caregivers of the intervention group; this change was greater that of seen in the control group at 1 month follow-up, but there was no difference at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The outcomes of the study reveal that sensor-based inhaler monitoring with clinical participant&#x02013;provider feedback may enhance asthma control and caregiver QoL in racially and socioeconomically diverse populations. However this improvement in outcomes for child and caregiver comes at the price of higher health care use, so further improvement in the sensor and participant&#x02013;provider feedback system is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The authors should be recognized for demonstrating that use of sensor monitoring for asthma medications in children can improve asthma control and caregiver QoL in diverse populations. However, these improvements may come at a price of increasing health care use &#x00028;steroid prescriptions&#x00029;. The limitations of the study include that data had to be manually entered because the blue chip device did not fit the inhaler and the absence of documentation or quantification of participant&#x02013;provider phone feedback and adherence in both study groups as well as cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XXX">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XXX</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the association between enrollment in high-deductible health plans &#x00028;HDHPs&#x00029; and asthma controller medication use and exacerbations.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A longitudinal cohort of children &#x00028;4&#x02013;17 years old&#x00029; and adults &#x00028;18&#x02013;64 years old&#x00029; on employer-sponsored insurance, who had at least 24 months of continuous insurance enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Identified from a national administrative claims database in the United States, patients with persistent asthma were selected, and their insurance was categorized as a HDHP, defined as an annual individual deductible of &#x02265;&#x00024;1000, or a traditional plan, with deductibles of &#x00024;0&#x02013;500. Enrollees in a HDHP were only those who switched from a traditional plan after 12 months to a HDHP for the following 12 months. A differences-in-differences analyses design was used to compare outcomes between patients who switched to a HDHP to that of controls, who remained in a traditional plan for the 24 months. Outcomes included controller medication fills, adherence, and asthma exacerbations.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The study sample included 7275 children and 17&#x02009;614 adults with HDHPs. In the differences-in-differences analyses among children, there were no differences in controller medical fill rates, except for a significant reduction in fills for inhaled corticosteroid &#x00028;ICS&#x00029; and long-acting beta-agonist &#x00028;LABA&#x00029; &#x00028;&#x02212;0.04; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: &#x02212;0.07 to &#x02212;0.01&#x00029;. There were also no significant changes in the proportion of days covered by a controller medication &#x00028;ie, adherence measure&#x00029;, steroid bursts, or asthma-related ED visits, comparing children with HDHPs to controls. Among adults with HDHPs, there were also no significant differences in outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The findings are consistent with previous adult studies that revealed that enrollment in HDHPs have minimal to no decrease in medication use and without significant changes in health outcomes. The authors think this is partly due to HDHPs exempting medications, like asthma controller medications, from deductibles. These medications are instead paid in a copayment arrangement.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This insurance policy approach reveals that HDHPs can be designed to support affordable coverage but also preserve necessary asthma care for patients.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YYY">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YYY</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease among children, and, although, in genome-wide association studies, researchers have identified specific loci related to asthma, there is little known about genetic determinants of asthma exacerbations. Recent evidence suggests some susceptibility variants for asthma-related outcomes are ethnicity specific. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of these susceptibility variants in Latino subgroups by performing a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of severe asthma exacerbations among Hispanic youth with asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This meta-analysis involved 4 separate studies &#x00028;Hartford Puerto Rico study, the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans study, the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica study, and the Social Change, Asthma and Allergy in Latin America study&#x00029; with a population of 4010 Latino children &#x00028;1693 Puerto Ricans, 1019 Costa Ricans, 640 Mexicans, 256 Brazilians, and 402 members from other Latino subgroups&#x00029;. A total of 2509 individuals with asthma and &#x02265;1 severe asthma exacerbation were included as cases, and 1501 individuals with asthma but no severe asthma exacerbation were included as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Methylation quantitative trait locus, expression quantitative trait locus, and expression quantitative trait methylation analyses were conducted to assess if the top single-nucleotide polymorphism &#x00028;SNP&#x00029; identified in the meta-analysis was linked to DNA methylation and gene expression in airway epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>In this meta-analysis, researchers found 1 SNP &#x00028;rs2253681&#x00029; in the FLJ22447 locus on chromosome 14q23.2 that was significantly associated with severe asthma exacerbations &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 &#x000D7; 10<sup>&#x02212;</sup>
<sup>8</sup>&#x00029;. Each copy of the minor allele of SNP rs2253681 was associated with 1.55 times increased odds of severe asthma exacerbations &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.34 to 1.79; <italic>P</italic> = 6.3 &#x000D7; 10<sup>&#x02212;</sup>
<sup>9</sup>&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>SNP rs2253681 was found to be significantly associated with severe asthma exacerbations in Latino children and adolescents with asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This study reveals the potential utility of genomics in the counseling and management of asthma. As more genetic mutations associated with asthma and asthma outcomes are identified, the better we can understand genetic components of this disease and can develop targeted therapies on the basis of gene-specific changes. Further genomic studies are needed to identify mutations associated with airway function and severe asthma exacerbations to identify those at risk for worse outcomes and those who may respond better to certain therapies on the basis of genetics.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZZ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZZ</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To investigate longitudinally whether asthma or wheeze at age 4 years of age was associated with lower physical activity levels at the age of 6 years.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 391 children from the Australian HealthNuts cohort who had follow-up at the ages of 4 and 6 years, agreed to wear an accelerometer, and returned valid data. At the age of 4 years, 8.7&#x00025; had current asthma, and 14.6&#x00025; had ever wheezed or had asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Asthma and wheeze data were collected by using a standardized, validated questionnaire at the ages of 4 and 6 years. Physical activity was measured through accelerometry after the age 6 visit. Participants wore an accelerometer watch on the wrist of their nondominant hand 24 hours per day for 8 consecutive days, even while sleeping, swimming, and bathing. Associations were investigated by using linear adjusted regression models. The primary outcome was daily minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity &#x00028;MVPA&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There was no evidence of difference in time spent in MVPA at the age of 6 years between children with and without asthma at the age of 4. Children with asthma spent 8.3 minutes more time physically active per day &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: &#x02212;5.6 to 22.1; <italic>P</italic> = .24&#x00029; than children without asthma did. Children with current wheeze spent 5.8 minutes per day more than those without did &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;5.9 to 17.5; <italic>P</italic> = .33&#x00029;, and those who had ever experienced wheeze or asthma spent 7.7 minutes per day more than those who had never done so &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;4.8 to 20.2; <italic>P</italic> = .23&#x00029;. Null results were also observed in the cross-sectional analyses. Interaction with BMI could not be assessed. Earlier asthma or wheeze status and sex were not found to modify these associations.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this study, the researchers found no evidence of an association between asthma and reduced physical activity in young Australian children.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Physical inactivity is a considerable risk factor for the development of a variety of illnesses. Asthma is the most common chronic condition in childhood and may result in unnecessary restrictions on physical activity in children, despite guidelines encouraging the opposite. With this prospective study, the authors provides evidence that there is no association between asthma or wheeze and decreased MVPA in Australian children. This reveals that Australian children are successfully maintaining physical activity despite asthma or wheezing. This success should be emulated in other settings and populations, to ensure that patients with asthma and their families are aware that physical activity is beneficial and should be encouraged in asthmatics.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAAA">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAAA</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression and impact on asthma control in pediatric patients with severe asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged &#x02265;4 years who were referred to the Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital Severe Asthma Program by a pediatric pulmonologist, allergist, or intensivist after a life-threatening asthma exacerbation.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a single-center prospective cohort study from March 2017 to December 2019. Asthma severity for each participant was defined on the basis of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute &#x00028;NHLBI&#x00029; asthma medication steps. At each clinical encounter, children completed the Patient Health Questionnaire &#x00028;PHQ-4&#x00029; and the Asthma Control Test &#x00028;ACT&#x00029; or childhood ACT with parental assistance and had spirometry done to assess lung function, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second &#x00028;FEV1&#x00029; to forced vital capacity. The association of the longitudinal psychological assessments and pulmonary function measures were determined by using a linear mixed model &#x00028;adjusted for sex, age, race, and NHLBI asthma medication step&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Data were obtained for 93 clinical encounters from 43 patients. The mean age was 11.7 &#x00028;&#x0002B;/&#x02212; 4.2&#x00029; years; 65&#x00025; were male &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 28 of 43&#x00029;; 49&#x00025; were White &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 22 of 43&#x00029;. The median NHLBI asthma medication step was 5.5 &#x00028;interquartile range: 4.5&#x02013;6.0&#x00029;. A total of 58&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 25 of 43&#x00029; had at least 1 symptom of anxiety and depression, and 19&#x00025; &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 8 of 43&#x00029; had a PHQ-4 score &gt;2, indicating at least mild impairment. Bivariate analyses after adjusting for age, sex, race, and medication step revealed a significant difference in mean ACT scores &#x00028;7 points lower&#x00029; for girls with a PHQ-4 score &gt;2 versus that of those with a score &#x02264;2 &#x00028;95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: &#x02212;10.88 to &#x02212;3.12; <italic>P</italic> = .01&#x00029;; this effect was not seen in mean ACT scores for boys with PHQ-4 scores &gt;2 versus that of those with scores &#x02264;2. Compared with girls, boys with PHQ-4 scores &gt;2 had a mean ACT score that was 4.18 points higher &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: 0.63 to 7.73; <italic>P</italic> = .03&#x00029;. A PHQ-4 score &gt;2 was significantly associated with percent FEV1 predicted but not with FEV1 to forced vital capacity &#x00028;95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;33.83 to 1.12; <italic>P</italic> = .06&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Pediatric patients with severe asthma often have comorbid mental health impairment, which is associated with poor asthma-related quality of life. Girls with greater anxiety and depression perceived significantly worse asthma control. No difference in perceived asthma control was seen in boys, regardless of anxiety or depression level.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Individuals with poorly controlled asthma can have psychological comorbidities including anxiety and depression, whereas, conversely, these factors can exacerbate asthma and negatively impact asthma control and severity. The perception of asthma control may impact self-care, asthma self-management, and inaccurate perception of symptoms, potentially resulting in higher rates of asthma-related health care use. Just as women often are more likely to report symptoms than men, the girls in this study had the higher level of mental health impairment and more negatively perceived asthma control. Although sex differences were observed in the association between psychological impairment and perceived asthma control, there was no association with objective spirometry results. Study limitations include the small sample size and use of PHQ-4, which is not a standard psychological screening tool. However, with these results, the authors highlight the potential impact of psychological symptoms in our clinical management of patients with asthma.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBBB">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBBB</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To identify latent classes of childhood asthma and determine if latent class assignments predict subsequent lung function abnormalities and exacerbation rate at 12 months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>2593 children aged 5 to 18 years enrolled in NHLBI clinical trials on mild-to-moderate asthma and who had documented adherence to article or electronic diaries.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Latent class analyses were performed on the subjects on the basis of data that had been obtained as part of the clinical trials, which included questionnaires, asthma documentation and characterization by spirometry, asthma control questionnaires, total immunoglobulin E, blood eosinophils, and allergy tests. Primary outcomes included pulmonary function and the exacerbation rate over 1 year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Five latent classes were identified. Class 1 was as follows: multiple allergic sensitizations with partially reversible airflow limitation. Class 2 was as follows: multiple sensitization with reversible airflow limitation; Class 3 was as follows: lesser sensitization with reversible airflow limitation. Class 4 was as follows: multiple sensitization with normal lung function. Class 5 was as follows: lesser sensitization with normal lung function. Lesser sensitization means mostly nonsensitivity or monosensitivity. Latent class 2 was the largest group &#x00028;35.7&#x00025;&#x00029;, followed by class 4 &#x00028;27.6&#x00025;&#x00029;, class 5 &#x00028;15.0&#x00025;&#x00029;, class 3 &#x00028;12.1&#x00025;&#x00029;, and class 1 &#x00028;9.4&#x00025;&#x00029;. Children in class 1 had lower pulmonary function at the end of the first year, with lesser treatment response. Children in class 2 revealed improvement in lung function with treatment, and seemed to respond to any controller therapy, whereas those in class 4 and 5 had a greater response to inhaled corticosteroids. Exacerbations occurred in 52.5&#x00025; of class 1, 43.0&#x00025; of class 4, 41.6&#x00025; of class 2, 36.8&#x00025; of class 3, and 34.1&#x00025; of class 5; class 1 had significantly increased exacerbations, compared with that of the other classes. Inhaled corticosteroids treatment significantly reduced exacerbations in classes 1, 2, and 4 but not in classes 3 and 5. Lung function deficits persisted despite treatment of class 1.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Exacerbation rates were highest in children with multiple sensitization and partially reversible airflow limitation. Sensitization and lung function measures in children may be useful for predicting future risk in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Because these children were all enrolled in asthma clinical trials, the results may not be generalizable to the overall pediatric asthma population, but the results do reveal that children with asthma may benefit from comanagement with an allergist to better predict those at the most risk and need for more than conventional medications.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CCCC">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843CCCC</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>The authors demonstrate that a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services &#x00028;CMS&#x00029; funded Community Asthma Initiative transition from a mixed nurse-community health worker model to a nurse supervised community health worker model could engender enhanced outcomes for hospitalizations and missed school and parent and/or guardian missed workdays.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 389 patients were enrolled under the CMS grant from 2013&#x02013;2015 at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital and 733 Medicaid patients enrolled from 2005&#x02013;2012 &#x00028;comparison group&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The 2 groups were compared at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post enrollment for 5 asthma outcome measures: emergency department visits, hospitalizations, physical activity limitations, missed school days, and parent and/or guardian missed workdays. These measures were analyzed as dichotomous variables by using logistic regression, with the numbers of occurrences as continuous variables. A 13 question survey composed of activity and emotional health subscales was used to assess quality of life changes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The CMS group demonstrated more improvement in asthma outcomes, compared with the comparison group. They had a greater odds of decreased hospitalization &#x00028;odds ratio: 3.13 [95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.49 to 6.59]&#x00029;, missed school days &#x00028;odds ratio: 1.91 [95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.09 to 3.36]&#x00029;, and parent and/or guardian missed workdays &#x00028;odds ratio: 2.72 [95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.15 to 6.41]&#x00029;.

The study is limited by fact that patient data were from 2 different time frames and the lack of spirometry testing to provide a more precise assessment of asthma control. The data supports that community engagement and home visits can be effective strategies to contain health care use and costs.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDDD">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDDD</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess the relationship between type of participation in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development &#x00028;HUD&#x00029; rental assistance programs with childhood asthma outcomes, such as emergency department &#x00028;ED&#x00029; or urgent care center &#x00028;UC&#x00029; use, diagnosis, and asthma exacerbations.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The population studied includes 2992 children, representative of the US population, between 0 and 17 years old who were receiving rental assistance &#x00028;HUD&#x00029; or who had not yet applied &#x00028;WLG&#x00029; to receive rental assistance between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2014. These records were linked to the National Health Interview Survey. HUD assists children through 3 programs: public housing, multifamily housing, and housing choice vouchers.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective survey study of linked data from the National Health Interview Survey and the National Center for Health Statistics. Deidentified data were used.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>In the HUD and WLG groups, some asthma outcomes were higher than those seen in the general low-income population. For HUD and WLG children, 23.2 and 24.1&#x00025;, had an asthma diagnosis, 43.6 and 45.6&#x00025; of those had an asthma exacerbation in the past year, and 45.4 and 60.7&#x00025; of those children visited the ED for asthma, respectively. In the general population with incomes &lt;150&#x00025; of the federal poverty level, without an HUD history, percentages were 12.8, 44.3, and 38.7, respectively. Participation in any rental assistance program was associated with an 18.2&#x00025; &#x00028;25&#x00025; relative reduction&#x00029; lower use of ED or UC for asthma in children who had an asthma attack in the past year. This association for ED and UC visits was significant in children participating in public or multifamily housing &#x00028;decreased by 36.6&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: &#x02212;54.8 to &#x02212;18.4&#x00029; but not housing choice vouchers &#x00028;decreased by 7.2&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: &#x02212;24.6 to &#x02212;10.3&#x00029;. No significant differences were noted in asthma attack or diagnosis rates.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>There was an 18.2&#x00025; decrease in ED use for asthma among children who received rental assistance, when compared with children waiting to enter a housing program. Differences were not explained by demographic factors, neighborhood characteristics, or primary care access.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In this publication, the authors highlight important structural factors, like housing stability and affordability, that may affect health outcomes in pediatric allergic patients. In previous studies, authors have noted mixed associations between pediatric asthma outcomes and voucher assistance given to public housing residents, with some variation by sex. The underlying factors that lead to differences in health outcomes on the basis of housing access and stress are poorly understood but may be affected by housing codes and percent of income spent on rent, which vary by housing assistance subgroups. Additional studies are necessary to understand whether these differences have any impact on clinical practice. One important limitation of this study is that only 36.8&#x00025; of subscribers were eligible for health and housing data linkage &#x00028;did not refuse and answered demographic and rental questions relevant to linkage&#x00029;; this may represent a selection bias for certain characteristics.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EEEE">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EEEE</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate if a multilevel home and preschool asthma educational program is more effective in improving asthma control, compared with a preschool-based program alone. Specifically, because this study was conducted within the Head Start program and targeted at an at risk population, with the study, the researchers examined if their multilevel intervention could address asthma disparities.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Eligible participants were caregivers with children aged 2 to 6 years with the confirmed physician-diagnosed of asthma who were also enrolled in one of 14 Head Start programs in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants were recruited from April 1, 2011, to November 31, 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Screening forms were provided through Head Start staff, and families who gave permission were contacted by telephone to confirm eligibility and schedule the first home visit. Families were randomly assigned to either the Action for a Better Community &#x00028;ABC&#x00029; Plus Head Start education group or the Head Start education alone group by using a 1:1 block randomization scheme. Families were not blinded to their random assignment, but the research assistants who completed assessments were blinded and were different from the intervention staff. The ABC family intervention consisted of 4 30- to 45-minute in-person, at-home asthma management educational sessions and 3 booster calls. Assessment visits were completed by research assistants: in home visits at baseline and 6 months and telephone visits at 3, 9, and 12 months. The primary outcome was the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids &#x00028;TRACK&#x00029; score to assess the degree of asthma control. Caregiver reports of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and courses of oral corticosteroids &#x00028;OCS&#x00029; in the previous 3 months were collected at each assessment visit. Caregiver health&#x02013;related quality of life was measured by using the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver&#x02019;s Quality of Life Questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 398 families were randomly assigned to either the ABC Plus Head Start educational program &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 199&#x00029; or Head Start educational program alone &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 199&#x00029;. Most participants were Black &#x00028;379 [95.2&#x00025;]&#x00029; and had a family income of less than &#x00024;40&#x02009;000 a year &#x00028;357 [89.7&#x00025;]&#x00029;. There were no significant group differences on any demographic characteristic. Of those in the intervention group, 144 &#x00028;72.4&#x00025;&#x00029; completed at least 1 home education session, 69 &#x00028;34.7&#x00025;&#x00029; completed all 4 home visits, and 71 &#x00028;35.8&#x00025;&#x00029; completed all the booster telephone calls after the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up surveys. Although there was an overall improvement in TRACK total scores for both groups over time &#x00028;&#x003B2; = 3.00; 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x00028;CI&#x00029;: 2.47 to 3.54; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, those in the intervention group had clinically significant score differences at 3 months, compared with that of those in the control group &#x00028;&#x003B2; = 6.26; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.77 to 10.75; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. There was no significant difference in TRACK scores among groups at months 6, 9, and 12. Participants in the intervention group were significantly less likely to have OCS use at 9 months &#x00028;&#x003B2; = &#x02212;0.61; 95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;1.13 to &#x02212;0.09; <italic>P</italic> = .02&#x00029; and hospitalization during the 12-month follow-up period &#x00028;odds ratio: 0.36; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.21 to 0.61; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. There was a significant improvement in asthma-related quality of life at 12 months for both groups &#x00028;&#x003B2; = 0.28; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.19 to 0.38; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029; but no difference between intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The multilevel asthma education intervention decreased several measures including asthma symptom scores at 3 months, OCS use at 9 months, and decreased hospitalizations during the 12-month follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>This educational program revealed modest improvements in asthma control and health care use. It is not entirely clear why TRACK scores only revealed differences at 3 months and OCS use at 9 months; however, the decrease in asthma hospitalization during 12-month follow-up indicates a true significant effect, especially because preschool-aged children have the highest risk for use of health care services. However, it should be noted that health care resources for asthma outcomes was collected via caregiver report and not verified by using medical records, possibly leading to bias. Overall, with this study, the authors highlight how implementation of an asthma educational program by using a community partner was an effective strategy for targeting a population disproportionately affected by health disparities.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FFFF">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843FFFF</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the role of white blood cell count, platelet count &#x00028;PLT&#x00029;, mean platelet volume &#x00028;MPV&#x00029;, and eosinophil percentage as objective markers of asthma control in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The study included 348 patients between the ages of 4 and 18 years diagnosed with asthma from January 2011 through September 2015 at the University of Health Sciences in Ankara, Turkey. Within the cohort, 63.2&#x00025; were male, and 43.1&#x00025; had controlled asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective and cross-sectional study in which subjects with asthma were separated into 2 groups: controlled and uncontrolled asthma &#x00028;by using the Asthma Control Test&#x00029;. Subjects were further subdivided into groups on the basis of medication use &#x00028;regular versus irregular&#x00029; and atopic status &#x00028;atopic versus nonatopic&#x00029;. The white blood cell count, PLT, MPV, eosinophil percentage, forced expiratory volume in 1 second &#x00028;&#x00025;&#x00029;, FVC &#x00028;&#x00025;&#x00029;, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second to FVC &#x00028;&#x00025;&#x00029; were extracted from each subject&#x02019;s medical record. Laboratory data were compared between patients in the controlled and uncontrolled asthma groups. The effect of medication use and atopic status on laboratory data were further analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The eosinophil percentage was significantly higher in the uncontrolled asthma group &#x00028;4.992 &#x000B1; 3.43&#x00029;, compared with that of the controlled asthma group &#x00028;3.493 &#x000B1; 2.24&#x00029; independent of atopic status. There were no significant differences in the PLT, MPV, or eosinophil percentages between asthmatics with and without atopy. The eosinophil percentage was significantly higher among asthmatics with regular medication use &#x00028;4.788 &#x000B1; 3.007&#x00029; versus that of those with irregular medication use &#x00028;3.986 &#x000B1; 3.077&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Eosinophil percentage may be an effective marker to monitor asthma control in the pediatric population.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Monitoring asthma control can be difficult in pediatric patients who are too young or unable to perform pulmonary function tests. With this study, the authors suggest a role for biomarkers, such as eosinophil percentage, in the monitoring of pediatric asthma. Eosinophil percentage could be used in the follow-up and treatment of asthma in pediatric patients who are unable to perform other objective tests. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm that eosinophil percentage is a reliable parameter.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GGGG">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843GGGG</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the magnitude of reduction in fractional exhaled nitric oxide &#x00028;FeNO&#x00029; after an oral corticosteroid &#x00028;OCS&#x00029; course in children with mild-to-moderate asthma and assess for any differential response from such treatment on the basis of race.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, the researchers included 92 children &#x00028;aged 11 &#x000B1; 3.3 years; White: <italic>n</italic> = 46 [50&#x00025;]; Hispanic: <italic>n</italic> = 30 [33&#x00025;]; African American [AA]: <italic>n</italic> = 16 [7&#x00025;]&#x00029; who presented to 1 urgent care in Denver, Colorado, for an acute asthma exacerbation from June 2010 to May 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this prospective cross-sectional cohort study, children aged 7 to 18 years with a physician diagnosis of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma and FeNO measurements within the past 6 months who received a short course of prednisone for acute exacerbation were enrolled. FeNO measurements were obtained at the time of exacerbation and at a 1 week follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>At baseline, AA children had significantly higher mean FeNO values, compared with that of both White &#x00028;48.9 vs 25.6 parts per billion; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .5&#x00029; and Hispanic children &#x00028;22.5 parts per billion; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .5&#x00029;, despite similar inhaled corticosteroid doses. During exacerbation, AAs had the highest FeNO values, without a difference in lung function compared with that of non-AAs. After OCSs, there was a 56.6&#x00025; reduction in FeNO among all children, whereas the relative reduction was similar between that in AAs and non-AAs &#x00028;53.9&#x00025; vs 57.8&#x00025;&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>FeNO values were reduced by &gt;50&#x00025; after a short course of OCSs among all children. AA children showed higher levels of FeNO at baseline and after treatment of exacerbation, although the relative reduction in FeNO was similar among groups.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>FeNO is a noninvasive tool for evaluating type 2 airway inflammation and predicting responses to inhaled corticosteroids, but less is known about how FeNO levels change in acute exacerbation or from OCSs. This study reveals clearly that such inflammation is likely alleviated by OCSs across racial and ethnic groups. Given the significantly higher FeNO levels in AA children, however, this also suggests that further research into racial differences in FeNO and how they are clinically correlated is warranted. It may help to explain disparities in health outcomes seen among AA children with asthma or guide therapies. Knowledge of participant environmental factors would be helpful in assessing the significance of the baseline results.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843HHHH">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843HHHH</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if oral prednisolones given to acutely wheezing preschool-aged children alter respiratory outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 3247 children &#x00028;aged 24&#x02013;59 months&#x00029; with acute wheezing episodes between August 2014 and September 2016 in 3 New Zealand emergency departments &#x00028;EDs&#x00029; were potentially eligible. A total of 493 were randomly assigned, and 477 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis &#x00028;238 in the prednisolone group and 239 in the placebo group&#x00029;. Primary outcome data were available on 393 patients &#x00028;82&#x00025; overall; 195 &#x00028;79&#x00025;&#x00029; in the prednisolone group and 198 &#x00028;83&#x00025;&#x00029; in the placebo group&#x00029;. Children &lt;24 months of age were purposely excluded, ensuring that those with bronchiolitis were not included.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheeze who presented to the ED were randomly assigned to receive 3 days of prednisolone &#x00028;2 mg/kg&#x00029; or a placebo. The primary outcome measure was a change in the validated Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure &#x00028;PRAM&#x00029; score 24 hours after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included PRAM score at 4 hours, admission rate, length of ED and inpatient stay, amount of albuterol given in 48 hours, additional treatment with open-label prednisolone, time to return to normal activity, and adverse events, including the need for intravenous &#x00028;IV&#x00029; medication, ICU admission, and representation to the ED or primary care provider within 7 days. Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure &#x00028;PRAM&#x00029; scores &#x00028;ranging from 0&#x02013;12&#x00029; were calculated on the basis of suprasternal retractions, scalene retractions, wheezing, and oxygen saturation in room air. The study was designed as an equivalence trial and powered &#x00028;power: 95&#x00025;&#x00029; to detect the minimal difference in PRAM scores that would disprove the null hypothesis that corticosteroids and placebo are equivalent treatments. In a pilot study &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 137&#x00029;, researchers determined a SD of 2.3 for change in PRAM score at 24 hours was significant. Therefore, analysis was by intention to treat.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Between groups, there was no difference in the primary outcome, the change in PRAM score at 24 hours &#x00028;difference between means: &#x02212;0.39; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: &#x02212;0.84 to 0.06, <italic>P</italic> = .09&#x00029;. The median PRAM score at 24 hours for both groups was 0, with only approximately one-third in either group showing mild disease &#x00028;PRAM score 1&#x02013;4&#x00029; and few with PRAM scores &gt;4 &#x00028;2.0&#x00025; and 3.6&#x00025; in treatment and control groups, respectively&#x00029;. Change in PRAM score at 4 hours was significantly different in the treatment group &#x00028;&#x02212;0.67; 95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;1.18 to &#x02212;0.16; <italic>P</italic> = .01&#x00029;. No difference in length of ED stay was observed &#x00028;&#x02212;0.57; 95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;1.15 to 0.02; <italic>P</italic> = .06&#x00029;, although admission to the hospital occurred more often in the placebo group &#x00028;0.67; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.45 to 1.01; <italic>P</italic> = .05&#x00029; as well as additional corticosteroid &#x00028;0.22; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.06 to 0.79; <italic>P</italic> = .01&#x00029; and IV medication use &#x00028;0.27; 95&#x00025; CI: 0.07 to 0.96; <italic>P</italic> = .03&#x00029;. No difference was observed in representation to the hospital or the primary care provider within 7 days &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .33 and <italic>P</italic> = .22, respectively&#x00029; or ICU admission &#x00028;undefined <italic>P</italic> value because only 2 total children went to the ICU&#x00029; as well as the amount of albuterol given in 48 hours &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .27&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Oral prednisolone does not alter respiratory outcomes at 24 hours or beyond in preschool-aged children presenting with acute wheezing to the ED because most children improved after 24 hours regardless of initial treatment. Subgroup analyses revealed no evidence that the 24-hour treatment effect differed for albuterol responsive children, those with a positive Asthma Predictive Index, or more severe disease at presentation &#x00028;higher PRAM score&#x00029;. However, those who received prednisolone had less respiratory distress 4 hours after medication administration and a reduced requirement for hospital admission, additional corticosteroid, or IV treatment. These findings suggest that early in-hospital administration of oral prednisolone to preschoolers with wheeze may prevent further deterioration and requirement for escalation of therapy. Additionally, considering the lack of significant difference at 24 hours, oral prednisolone may improve short-term respiratory outcomes for preschoolers presenting with wheeze. However, subsequent doses of oral prednisolone may provide no additional therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this robustly designed randomized controlled trial, we are reminded that wheezing preschoolers are a heterogeneous group with numerous factors contributing to a wheezy phenotype. We should consider that they should not be treated the same as older asthmatics, with regards to corticosteroids. With this study, the authors question oral steroid dosing dogma and demonstrate that oral prednisolone may improve short-term respiratory outcomes for wheezing preschoolers but subsequent doses of oral prednisolone may provide no additional therapeutic benefit. Further studies are needed in this population to understand the timing and dosing of corticosteroids.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843IIII">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843IIII</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the association between exposure to oral corticosteroid bursts with severe adverse medical events.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A retrospective cohort was derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan of children &#x00028;&lt;18 years old&#x00029; from 2013&#x02013;2017.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>By using a national database of medical claims and prescription data, a self-controlled case series was used to compare risks in a pretreatment period before corticosteroid exposure &#x00028;5&#x02013;90 days&#x00029; and 2 posttreatment periods &#x00028;5&#x02013;30 days and 31&#x02013;90 days&#x00029;. The primary outcomes were the incidence rate ratios per 1000 person-years for gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, pneumonia, and glaucoma after oral corticosteroid burst exposure among children who did or did not receive the oral corticosteroid bursts. Exposure to corticosteroid burst was defined as a prescription record of oral corticosteroids for &#x02264;14 days. A conditional fixed-effect Poisson regression model was used.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The study sample included 4&#x02009;542&#x02009;623 children of which 42&#x00025; received at least 1 oral corticosteroid burst, and the mean age was 9.7 &#x00028;SD: 5.8&#x00029; years. The most common reason for corticosteroid use was acute upper respiratory infection &#x00028;34&#x00025;&#x00029; and allergic diseases &#x00028;31&#x00025;&#x00029;, including urticaria &#x00028;11.0&#x00025; to 11.9&#x00025;&#x00029;, contact dermatitis or eczema &#x00028;9.1&#x00025; to 10.3&#x00025;&#x00029;, asthma &#x00028;5.2&#x00025; to 7.1&#x00025;&#x00029;, and allergic rhinitis &#x00028;3.2&#x00025; to 3.4&#x00025;&#x00029;.

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate the effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy &#x00028;SCIT&#x00029; on asthma in inner-city children &lt;4 years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children between the ages of 18 to 47 months were recruited when seen in the asthma or allergy clinic at Jacobi Medical Center in Bronx, New York, which cares for a mostly low-income, inner-city population. Participants were required to have physician-diagnosed asthma or at least 2 lifetime episodes of wheezing and be at high risk of persistent asthma on the basis of an Asthma Predictive Index. Patients with any other chronic medical condition, history of severe prematurity, or a sustained oxygen requirement at birth were excluded. Although all patients had at least 1 common environmental allergen positive on skin-prick testing, most had multiple and mainly indoor allergen sensitizations. The majority of patients were male and used an asthma controller medication, with an average asthma symptom score indicating mild persistent asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to the SCIT &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 27&#x00029; or control group &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 23&#x00029;. SCIT was administered per published guidelines, with biweekly maintenance injections. Asthma, nasal-ocular, and skin symptom scores and medication use were monitored by a phone call every 2 weeks. In interim power analysis, it was indicated there was an insufficient sample size to reach the planned power of 80&#x00025;, so the study was terminated early before some participants had completed SCIT for 3 years.RESULTS: On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis, there was no statically significant difference in asthma, nasal-ocular, or skin symptom scores in the SCIT and control groups. Quality of life, as assessed by the parent, showed significant improvement in the SCIT group &#x00028;&#x003B2; coefficient: 0.32; SE: 0.09; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; .01&#x00029;, particularly related to interference of child&#x02019;s asthma on family or work plans and nighttime symptoms. Allergen specific serum immunoglobulin G4 levels increased in the SCIT group only &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; .04&#x00029;. New allergen sensitization or loss of sensitization rates at the end of the study were not significantly different between the SCIT and control groups. Systemic reactions occurred in in 22&#x00025; of children and 1.8&#x00025; of injections, all of which were mild and resolved with antihistamine administration. Children in the SCIT group missed 28&#x00025; of injection visits.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS: </title><p>Apart from improved quality of life, allergen immunotherapy in inner-city children with asthma &lt;4 years of age did not show significant improvement in asthma, allergy, or eczema clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although perhaps limited by small sample size and a high rate of missed appointments, with the results, the authors support the common practice of waiting until near 5 years of age to start SCIT. Factors unique to an inner-city, younger pediatric population may warrant larger studies to determine the efficacy of early immunotherapy in improving asthma.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KKKK">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843KKKK</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To assess the impact of early antibiotic use in the treatment of asthma exacerbation without comorbid bacterial infection on clinical outcomes and resource use.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 48&#x02009;743 children between 3 months and 15 years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation with no evidence of bacterial infection who were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting &#x003B2;-agonists.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Cases were retrospectively identified from an inpatient database, including records from &gt;1000 hospitals in Japan. Those who received antibiotics during the first 2 days of hospitalization were included in the early treatment group, whereas those who had antibiotic therapy after the first 2 days or not at all were considered the untreated group. The primary outcome was the mean length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization cost, risk of mechanical ventilation, risk of readmission, and risk of probiotic use because of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 19&#x02009;866 &#x00028;40.8&#x00025;&#x00029; of 48&#x02009;743 eligible children were included in the early treatment group. This group had a longer hospital stay &#x00028;average difference: 0.21 days; 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.25&#x00029;, higher cost of hospitalization &#x00028;mean difference: &#x00024;83.5; 95&#x00025; CI: 62.9 to 104&#x00029;, and higher rate of probiotic use &#x00028;rate ratio: 2.01; 95&#x00025; CI: 1.81 to 2.23&#x00029;. The risk of 30-day readmission did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The risk of mechanical ventilation was similar or slightly higher in the early treatment group, depending on the statistical model.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Early antibiotic treatment in asthma exacerbation is associated with several negative outcomes without clear clinical benefit: slightly longer hospital stay, increased health care costs, increased risk of probiotic use, and possibly higher risk of mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Despite the known association of viral respiratory tract infections with asthma exacerbations in children, there continues to be high rates of antibiotic use for pediatric asthma exacerbations in developed countries. There have been conflicting results of studies examining the utility of early antibiotic use, particularly macrolide therapy, for asthma exacerbation. With this study, the authors add to evidence illustrating that risks of antibiotic therapy outweigh benefits in the treatment of asthma exacerbation without evidence of bacterial infection.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LLLL">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843LLLL</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To investigate if supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> would improve the time to a severe exacerbation in children at high risk with vitamin D insufficiency and taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids &#x00028;ICSs&#x00029; for persistent asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>The participants were recruited from 7 children&#x02019;s hospitals across the United States. Participants, 6 to 16 years of age, had to have physician-diagnosed asthma for at least 1 year, being treated with low-dose ICSs, and have a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL. They also had to have at least 1 severe asthma exacerbation in the last year &#x00028;defined as systemic steroids for at least 3 days or an emergency department visit or hospitalization requiring systemic corticosteroids&#x00029;. All participants had to show bronchodilator responsiveness or airway responsiveness to methacholine inhalation. The mean age of the participants was 9.8 years &#x00028;40&#x00025; girls&#x00029;. A total of 219 subjects passed screening and entered run-in. A total of 192 subjects were randomly assigned to active drug or placebo capsules.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants initially all received placebo capsules and were maintained on inhaled fluticasone propionate, 176 &#x003BC;g per day &#x00028;6&#x02013;11 years&#x00029; or 220 &#x003BC;g per day &#x00028;12&#x02013;16 years&#x00029; during run-in. They continued the ICSs and then were randomly assigned to daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 4000 IU or continuing placebo for 48 weeks. After 24 weeks, participants dose of fluticasone was reduced by 50&#x00025;, if asthma was well controlled and spirometry was normal. Serum vitamin D levels and parameters of asthma control were measured every 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants in whom the dose of ICS was reduced halfway through the trial, and the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 94&#x00025; of randomly assigned subjects completed the trial. A total of 36 participants &#x00028;37.5&#x00025;&#x00029; in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group and 33 &#x00028;34.4&#x00025;&#x00029; in the placebo group had &#x02265;1 severe exacerbations. Compared with the placebo, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation did not significantly improve the time to a severe exacerbation. The mean time to exacerbation was 240 days in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group versus 253 days in the placebo group &#x00028;mean group difference: &#x02212;13.1 days; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.13; <italic>P</italic> = .63&#x00029;. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, compared with the placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants whose dose of ICSs was reduced, or the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Serious adverse events were similar in both groups &#x00028;vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group: <italic>n</italic> = 11; placebo group: <italic>n</italic> = 9&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In children 6 to 16 years old with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, compared with a placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a severe asthma exacerbation or ICS dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>As the authors note, in several observational studies, researchers have linked low serum vitamin D levels to severe asthma exacerbations, lower lung function, and reduced response to corticosteroids. Yet meta-analyses and reviews of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation for severe asthma exacerbations have found insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in children. In this study, the authors, looking at a high-risk population for asthma exacerbations, add to that negative body of literature.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MMMM">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843MMMM</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the role of vitamin D supplementation as adjunct therapy in improving pediatric asthma control.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate persistent asthma &#x00028;defined as step 3 per Global Initiative for Asthmas [GINA] guidelines&#x00029; were enrolled. Individuals with coexisting pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and/or endocrine conditions that contributed to vitamin D deficiency or parathyroid disease and/or required vitamin D or calcium supplements in the previous 3 months were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This 3-month randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Western India. Baseline clinical information was recorded, spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide &#x00028;FeNO&#x00029; were performed as per American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations, and serum 25&#x00028;OH&#x00029;D level was measured. Subjects were randomly assigned to 2000 IU per day of vitamin D or placebo. Spirometry, FeNO, and a venous blood sample were repeated at 3 months post enrollment. During the study period, subjects in both groups were placed on budesonide-formoterol 100mcg/6mcg inhalation 2 puffs twice daily for maintenance, with a short-acting &#x003B2; agonist to use as needed. Participants recorded asthma symptoms and use of rescue inhaler daily. Asthma control using the childhood asthma control test &#x00028;C-ACT&#x00029; and compliance with maintenance treatment and intervention therapy &#x00028;drug versus placebo&#x00029; were assessed at monthly visits. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 60 children &#x00028;intervention: 30; placebo: 30&#x00029; were included in the study. Although 2 participants were lost to follow-up in each group &#x00028;<italic>N</italic> = 56&#x00029;, all 60 children were analyzed as per the intention-to-treat protocol. Demographics, preenrollment asthma medication use, medical history, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels were similar between the 2 groups. The intervention group had significantly higher baseline C-ACT score, compared with that of the placebo group &#x00028;18 vs 15.5; <italic>P</italic> = .001&#x00029;, although both groups had mean C-ACT scores &lt;19, indicating similarly, poorly controlled asthma at baseline. Both groups had significant improvement in C-ACT score and forced expiratory volume in 1 second at the end of the study period, when compared with the baseline. However, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of the C-ACT score, even after adjusting for baseline scores, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FeNO, health care use &#x00028;number of exacerbations, emergency visits, hospital admissions&#x00029;, and adverse effects &#x00028;relating to intervention&#x00029;. The intervention group had improvement in serum vitamin D levels at 3-months &#x00028;35.5 ng/mL vs 18.8; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to standard maintenance therapy in children with moderate persistent asthma does not improve asthma control.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although vitamin D deficiency has been reportedly associated with more severe asthma exacerbations, steroid-refractory asthma, and lower pulmonary function, there continues to be conflicting literature regarding the impact of vitamin D supplementation on childhood asthma. Larger studies using different vitamin D doses in children with different asthma severities, over longer periods of time, and in different parts of the world will be needed to determine if, if any, there is utility for vitamin D supplements in asthma. In the meantime, ensuring compliance with daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy and regular follow-up with the clinicians remain the cornerstone of effective asthma management.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NNNN">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843NNNN</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF STUDY:</title><p>To assess whether biologics could be given safely at home in children with severe asthma, including measuring spirometry and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children with severe asthma who had received omalizumab or mepolizumab and were willing to administer medication by supervised video calls in London, England, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from April to July 2020.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>In the study, children were identified who previously received at least 3 doses of biologics in the clinic or hospital setting safely with no reactions, were deemed suitable by a multidisciplinary team, and had no previous experience with home medication administration. Patients and their caretakers were trained for 1 to 2 hours, after which clinical nurse specialists virtually observed them during home medication administration. Patients and their families were given a home spirometer that measured forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity &#x00028;FVC&#x00029; to track asthma status. They were then managed every 2 to 4 weeks, with video calls to assist with medication dosing, assess asthma control, determine if oral corticosteroids &#x00028;OCSs&#x00029; were required or unscheduled health care visits, and determine general well-being the preceding 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 16 of 23 patients with a median age of 14.5 years &#x00028;6 to 18 years&#x00029; fulfilled the criteria for homecare and consented. A total of 14 adolescents independently completed home administration, and 2 required community nursing to administer the medication. Seven patients who did not participate in home administration served as the control group. Video calls with medication dosing were completed on 75 occasions. The drug was administered improperly on 2 of 75 occasions. Spirometry was used before each virtual appointment to assess asthma control. Patients and parents felt confident with video monitoring at the time of injection and felt relieved that they did not have to travel to the hospital for drug administration. Overall, patients felt monitoring devices were easy to use. Both Asthma Control Test and mini Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores improved within the first 3 months during home administration.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Home administration of biologics with virtual monitoring is feasible and acceptable for patients and their families.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Mepolizumab and omalizumab are available for home infusion for children &#x02265;12. There is concern over which patients will be the &#x0201C;right&#x0201D; patient for this treatment method. Indeed, during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, home infusion options would have been beneficial. Although the number of patients with home infusions is small in this study, it does suggest a valuable combination of parameters to follow at home with a portable forced expiratory volume in 1 second meter and asthma control tests. Video supervision and telehealth is a practical option, ensures safety and support for families, and reinforces asthma medication adherence. Telehealth administration of biologics could reduce severe asthma attacks, increase patient satisfaction and convenience, and decrease the burden of coming to the hospital/clinic for the severe child with asthma.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OOOO">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843OOOO</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab and mepolizumab and better understand the clinical characteristics of real-world populations treated with these biologics.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In the study, researchers included 478 patients from the Wessex Asthma Cohort recruited from a difficult to control asthma clinic in the United Kingdom. Patients were seen between June 2006 and May 2019. Inclusion criteria included patients on &#x0201C;high dose therapies&#x0201D; and/or &#x0201C;continuous or frequent use of oral corticosteroids.&#x0201D;</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective study of biological na&#x000EF;ve patients with severe asthma. In the study, researchers compared 182 patients who started either omalizumab or mepolizumab and 178 patients who did not start biological therapy. Data concerning asthma control were collected at the baseline visit and each injection visit. The effectiveness of biologics was determined by using biological specific standard criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Omalizumab treated subjects were found to be younger and more ethnically diverse and had higher prevalence of rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and nasal polyps, compared with that of the mepolizumab or no biological treatment groups. Mepolizumab-treated subjects had greater eosinophilia and were diagnosed later in life. They also had more nasal polyps than the control group did. Both biological therapies significantly improved asthma control and reduced asthma exacerbations, acute health care encounters, and maintenance oral steroid dose. Patients in the nonresponder groups were evaluated and found to have worse baseline asthma control and greater prevalence of anxiety, when compared with biological responders.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Omalizumab and mepolizumab both showed significant clinical benefit in real-world populations. Omalizumab patients were younger and more atopic. Mepolizumab patients were older with a less atopic phenotype. Nonresponders had more severe asthma at that baseline and more psychological comorbidities.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>It has been widely discussed that populations in clinical trials of asthma biologics are not representative of the full population that needs these therapies. In this cohort study, the authors evaluate the efficacy of these 2 biologics in real-world populations. There is no information on how the biological was selected, but, with this cohort, the authors still gives valuable information about the population characteristics and potential exacerbating factors in biological nonresponders. The authors also highlight that both omalizumab and mepolizumab were highly efficacious.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PPPP">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843PPPP</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To examine the outcomes of population newborn screening &#x00028;NBS&#x00029; for severe combined immunodeficiency &#x00028;SCID&#x00029; by using T-cell receptor excision circles &#x00028;TRECs&#x00029; after the first decade of implementation in Massachusetts.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Infants born in Massachusetts screened through the New England Newborn Screening Program between February 1, 2009, and January 31, 2019.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>The authors present a population cohort of infants receiving NBS for SCID, both before and after mandatory NBS implementation in 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of 720&#x02009;038 infants screened, normal TRECs were identified in 99.71&#x00025;. At least 1 abnormal specimen was identified in 2072 infants &#x00028;0.29&#x00025; of those screened&#x00029;. Of these infants, 1771 had an additional TREC result, which was normal, and were released from the screening program &#x00028;83.8&#x00025; of those with an abnormal TREC result before confirmatory flow cytometry and 1.7&#x00025; after further lymphocyte phenotyping&#x00029;. Further evaluation by flow cytometry occurred in 237 infants &#x00028;11.4&#x00025; of those with at least 1 abnormal TREC result&#x00029;, and low na&#x000EF;ve T-cell percentages were associated with a greater risk of a combined immunodeficiency. A total of 9 infants were diagnosed with SCID or leaky SCID, 7 were diagnosed with other combined immunodeficiencies, and 3 were diagnosed with athymia &#x00028;0.4&#x00025;, 0.3&#x00025;, and 0.1&#x00025;, respectively. of those with an abnormal TREC screen&#x00029;. The incidence of SCID or leaky SCID was reported as &#x0223C;1 in 80&#x02009;000; however, more broadly, the incidence of severe T-cell lymphopenia for which definitive treatment was indicated was &#x0223C;1 in 50&#x02009;000 infants. All patients with SCID or leaky SCID underwent hematopoietic cell transplant or gene therapy for which survival was 100&#x00025;, and 1 patient with athymia underwent a successful thymus transplant. With NBS, the researchers successfully identified all known cases of SCID. Compared with survival before NBS by TREC, survival improved significantly for infants with SCID or leaky SCID &#x00028;100&#x00025; [<italic>n</italic> = 9] vs 57&#x00025; [<italic>n</italic> = 7]. Of 162 infants with T-cell counts &lt;2500 but above 1500 &#x000B5;L, no cases of SCID were identified, but 8 infants were diagnosed with partial DiGeorge syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>NBS of TREC levels is highly sensitive and specific, with the ability to improve early diagnosis of SCID. When compared with historical rates of SCID diagnosis and management before TREC evaluation by NBS, screening can reduce the time to transplant &#x00028;3.4 months versus 6.5 months&#x00029; and improve outcomes for infants with SCID.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Screening for SCID has been a significant addition to NBS programs across the country, and multiple studies have suggested this to be a cost-effective strategy. As of December 2018, all 50 states have begun to screen for SCID at birth. SCID is often unrecognized in early life, but survival improves with early diagnosis. With this study, the authors provide long-term outcomes and highlight the benefit of these programs, suggesting a 43&#x00025; reduction in mortality from a condition that can be successfully treated when identified early. From these data, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value can be calculated &#x00028;100&#x00025;, 99.7&#x00025;, 100&#x00025;, and 0.91&#x00025;, respectively&#x00029;. Notably, despite high sensitivity and specificity, a population prevalence of &#x0223C;1:50&#x02009;000 to 80&#x02009;000 lowers the positive predictive value of screening. Although early referral to an immunologist is important in infants with abnormal TREC results, these data also suggest the absolute risk of SCID in these infants is low &#x00028;&lt;1&#x00025;&#x00029;. Thus, when counseling families of infants with an abnormal TREC screen, there is room for cautious optimism, pending results of definitive testing. More work is needed to better understand the short- and longer-term psychosocial impacts of a false-positive NBS result for SCID on families with unaffected infants after a positive screening test result.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843QQQQ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843QQQQ</ext-link>

Additionally, in the study, the researchers assessed infection prevention management practices used by Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium &#x00028;PIDTC&#x00029; centers in SCID infants before HSCT.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, we included 59 infants diagnosed with SCID via NBS or FH who underwent HSCT &#x00028;PIDTC protocol 6901&#x00029; among 25 different PIDTC centers between 2010&#x02013;2014.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study had 2 parts. Part 1 was a retrospective chart review in which researchers evaluated age at SCID diagnosis, method of diagnosis &#x00028;NBS versus FH&#x00029;, age at infection onset, type and frequency of infection&#x00028;s&#x00029;, time to HSCT, and outcomes. Part 2 was a 29-question survey administered to 42 PIDTC centers inquiring about their pre-HSCT management practices for SCID infants. With the survey, the researchers assessed infection prevention management practices including location &#x00028;inpatient versus outpatient&#x00029;, antimicrobial prophylaxis, immunoglobulin therapies, and practices for monitoring and preventing viral infections.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Part 1 &#x00028;infection and survival outcomes&#x00029; results were as follows: Among the 59 infants diagnosed with SCID, 64&#x00025; were diagnosed via NBS, and 36&#x00025; were diagnosed via FH. Infants with FH were diagnosed significantly earlier than those diagnosed by NBS &#x00028;median: 6 days versus 25 days, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Patients diagnosed via NBS were more likely to experience at least 1 pre-HSCT infection, compared with those diagnosed by FH &#x00028;55&#x00025; vs 19&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> = .012&#x00029; and had higher infection density &#x00028;0.3 per month versus 0.1 per month; <italic>P</italic> = .029&#x00029;. The rate of active infection at the time of HSCT was higher in patients diagnosed by NBS &#x00028;39&#x00025; vs 5&#x00025;; <italic>P</italic> = .005&#x00029;. The location of pre-HSCT management &#x00028;outpatient versus inpatient&#x00029; did not impact infection rates. The most common infections reported in both groups were cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and respiratory viruses. The median time to HSCT was significantly longer in those diagnosed by NBS, compared with that of those diagnosed by FH &#x00028;96.5 days versus 49 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Two-year survival post-HSCT was comparable &#x00028;89&#x00025;&#x00029; in both groups. Part 2 &#x00028;survey&#x00029; results were as follows: 50 physicians from 42 PIDTC centers completed the survey with 100&#x00025; response rate. Initiation of SCID management was started at a median age of 21 days. There were variable recommendations on location of pre-HSCT management, although 31&#x00025; routinely planned for inpatient care and 17&#x00025; routinely planned for outpatient care. Inpatient hygiene measures were variable, but most &#x00028;70&#x00025;&#x00029; recommended reverse isolation with &#x00028;50&#x00025;&#x00029; or without &#x00028;20&#x00025;&#x00029; positive pressure ventilation. Most centers &#x00028;79&#x00025;&#x00029; restricted nonstaff caregivers to 2 individuals. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended against <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> universally &#x00028;most commonly, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: 91&#x00025;&#x00029;, although the age at initiation varied. Fungal prophylaxis was routinely started by 79&#x00025;, although the timing and agent varied. Most providers &#x00028;98&#x00025;&#x00029; used immunoglobulin, although routes varied. A minority of centers &#x00028;45&#x00025;&#x00029; routinely recommended viral prophylaxis with acyclovir. Routine viral screening was performed for cytomegalovirus at 93&#x00025; of centers, whereas monitoring for other viruses &#x00028;Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus&#x00029; was not consistent.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Infants diagnosed with SCID via FH were diagnosed sooner, were less likely to develop infection pre-HSCT, and had a shorter time to HSCT, when compared with those diagnosed by NBS. Despite this, 2-year survival post-HSCT was the same. Pre-HSCT medical management was variable among PIDTC centers, specifically the location of pre-HSCT management outpatient versus that of inpatient.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>T-cell receptor excision circle analysis is an easy and efficient way to screen for SCID and now part of the NBS in all 50 states. Because of this, we are now able to diagnose and intervene early for SCID infants, greatly improving these vulnerable patients&#x02019; clinical outcomes. Despite this, when comparing infants diagnosed with SCID by NBS with those diagnosed by FH, NBS falls short. In this study, the authors found that infants diagnosed with SCID by NBS had a longer time to diagnosis and HSCT, had a higher infection density, and were more likely to be infected at time of HSCT. Although all 50 states screen for SCID on NBS, it is clear there is more work to be done to streamline evaluation and management to reduce delays to and infections before HSCT. Additionally, there is robust data supporting early HSCT to improve clinical outcomes, but even at PIDTC centers, pre-HSCT management practices for SCID infants is variable. Clinicians would benefit from more uniform SCID management guidelines in the future.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RRRR">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843RRRR</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine if increasing IgG trough levels was associated with decreased rates of infection in patients with primary immunodeficiency &#x00028;PID&#x00029; who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin &#x00028;IVIG&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This systematic review included data from 1218 patients with PID who were treated with IVIG from 28 studies between 2001 and 2018. Both children and adults were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a systematic review of studies in PubMed and Cochrane and meta-regression analysis in which researchers evaluated immunoglobulin G &#x00028;IgG&#x00029; trough levels and their impact on clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The mean IgG trough levels in this analysis ranged from 660 mg/dL to 1280 mg/dL. The mean IVIG dose ranged from 387 mg/kg to 560 mg/kg dosed every 3-4 weeks &#x00028;the majority were on every 4 week dosing&#x00029;. The most common PIDs reported in this study were common variable immunodeficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia &#x00028;XLA&#x00029;. By using random-effects linear regression slope, IgG trough levels increased by 73 mg/dL for every IVIG dose increase of 100 mg/kg per 4 weeks. Increasing trough level up to a maximum trough of 1280 mg/dL significantly decreased hospitalization &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .02&#x00029; but did not significantly decrease infection rates &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .21&#x00029; or missed school days or workdays &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .08&#x00029;. A break point IgG trough level of 960 mg/dL was identified to significantly decrease infection rates &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .018&#x00029;, and, for &gt;960 mg/dL, there was no significant decrease in infection rates.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In patients with PID who were treated with IVIG, increasing IgG trough levels up to 960 mg/dL was associated with improved clinical outcomes and a decreased rate of infection.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Goal IgG trough levels have not been clearly established for patients with PID treated with IVIG therapy. In this study, the authors found that increasing IgG trough levels up to a trough of 960 mg/dL decreases the rate of infection. Increasing trough levels &gt;960 mg/dL is significantly associated with decreased hospitalization rates but not with decreased infections or missed school days or workdays. Given that there is a wide range of IVIG dosing used in the treatment of PID, this study is helpful and offers trough targets on the basis of desired effect &#x00028;eg, reducing infection rates versus reducing hospitalization rates&#x00029;. One limitation of this study is the inability to differentiate between various disease states, such as XLA, which may necessitate a higher IgG trough. Additionally, all studies were cohort studies, which increases the heterogeneity of the population studied.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SSSS">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843SSSS</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the impact of antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections &#x00028;RTIs&#x00029; on the subsequent risk of RTI-related hospitalizations in children with Down syndrome &#x00028;DS&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Children aged &#x02264;18 years &#x00028;defined in groups: 0&#x02013;1 years; 1&#x02013;5 years; 5&#x02013;10 years; and 10&#x02013;18 years&#x00029;, with DS &#x00028;as identified by Read and <italic>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision</italic>, codes&#x00029; were included. Each child with DS in the cohort were frequency matched by general practitioner &#x00028;GP&#x00029;, sex, birth year &#x00028;&#x0002B;/&#x02212; 5 years&#x00029;, and start of follow-up age &#x02264;18 years &#x00028;follow-up was defined as a period of 28 days from the initial RTI-related GP consultation or until the first RTI-related hospitalization&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Information regarding health care use was extrapolated from Clinical Disease Research Using Linked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Health Records, an electronic health records database in the United Kingdom, on the basis of Read and <italic>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision</italic>, codes, to classify types of RTIs &#x00028;lower respiratory tract infection; upper respiratory tract infection; unclassified&#x00029; and probable versus possible RTI, identify diagnosis of DS and other comorbidities, and determine admission and discharge dates. Extracted data were reviewed and confirmed by a committee of clinicians and academic professionals. Logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of antibiotic prescriptions on the risk of subsequent RTI-related hospitalization in DS patients with RTI-related GP consultations. In subgroup analyses, the researchers further explored the effect of antibiotics across different age groups and type of RTI.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Both cohorts &#x00028;DS: 992; control: 4874&#x00029; had similar demographic characteristics for sex and age. There were more White individuals in the group with DS versus in the control group &#x00028;58.5&#x00025; vs 41.8&#x00025;&#x00029; and more comorbidities in the group with DS. Antibiotic prescriptions after an RTI-related GP consultation did not significantly reduce the risk of the 28-day RTI-related hospitalization for either group, even after adjusting for antibiotic prescription, age group, sex, presence of congenital heart disease, presence of asthma, and number of previous RTI-related hospitalizations and RTI-related GP consultations in the previous 6 months. When adjusted for the same covariates, RTI-related hospitalizations were significantly reduced in DS individuals aged 0&#x02013;1 years who were prescribed antibiotics for RTI-related concerns &#x00028;adjusted odds ratio: 0.260; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 0.077 to 0.876&#x00029; but not in other age groups. This protective effect was also not seen by type of RTI or in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Aside from infants aged 0 to 1 years with DS, antibiotic prescriptions did not reduce RTI-related hospitalizations.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>It appears that children with DS are frequently prescribed antibiotics for viral infections in the United Kingdom. Although antibiotics have not been shown to reduce hospitalizations for RTI in the general pediatric population, in previous studies, researchers did not include children with comorbidities, prompting these authors to specifically examine children with DS. It is unclear how antibiotic prescribing behavior for this special population compares between the United Kingdom and the United States, thus limiting the generalizability of these results. Nevertheless, the authors surmise that nonantibiotic interventions to manage RTIs in medically complex children can be effective, which is consistent with our outpatient stewardship efforts to combat antibiotic misuse and resistance in the United States.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TTTT">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843TTTT</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To evaluate if the severity of T-cell lymphopenia is associated with immune dysregulation, such as autoimmunity and asthma, in patients with DiGeorge syndrome &#x00028;DGS&#x00029; and/or TBX1 mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers included 415 patients with DGS and/or TBX1 mutations from the US Immunodeficiency Network registry. Patients with complete and atypical complete DGS were excluded. The median age was 4.6 years &#x00028;range: 0&#x02013;45 years&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a retrospective analysis of 415 patients with DGS and/or TBX1 mutations from the US Immunodeficiency Network registry. Patients were stratified on the basis of severity of initial absolute CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T cells. The rate of infections, autoimmunity, and atopic disease were compared by using &#x003C7;<sup>2</sup> tests and multivariate logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>In this DGS cohort, the median absolute CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T-cell count was 1424 &#x00028;range: 85&#x02013;6371 cells/&#x003BC;l&#x00029;. Among the 415 DGS patients, 25&#x00025; reported congenital heart disease, 4.1&#x00025; reported autoimmunity, and 6.7&#x00025; reported asthma. Absolute CD3 counts were lower in those with cardiac disease &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Patients with absolute CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T cells &lt;50&#x00025; of age-adjusted normal values were more likely to have reported autoimmunity &#x00028;odds ratio: 7.56; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.58 to 36.17; <italic>P</italic> = .01&#x00029; and asthma &#x00028;odds ratio: 4.5; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 1.06 to 18.93; <italic>P</italic> = .04&#x00029; when compared with those with normal T cell counts. The most commonly reported autoimmune conditions were thyroid disease and cytopenias. Patients with reported autoimmunity more frequently had low CD19<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> B cells &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .002&#x00029; and low immunoglobulin G &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .005&#x00029;, when compared with those without autoimmunity. There was no association noted between low CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T cells and immunoglobulin levels or infection rates.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Patients with DGS and absolute CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T cells &lt;50&#x00025; of age-adjusted normal levels had a higher odds of developing autoimmunity and/or asthma, when compared with those with normal T cell counts.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Although it is well known that DGS increases the risk for autoimmunity and atopy, in this study, the authors investigated the association between the severity of T-cell lymphopenia and odds of autoimmunity and atopy. Patients with absolute CD3<sup>&#x0002B;</sup> T cells &lt;50&#x00025; of age-adjusted normal levels had a significantly higher odds of developing autoimmunity and/or asthma. This information is useful to providers because it helps us identify those at higher risk for developing autoimmunity and/or asthma and allows us to heighten our surveillance in this population, especially because autoimmunity and/or asthma had increasing frequency with advancing age. This was a large study of DGS patients nationally; however, it was limited by the nature of registry data, which had variable areas of missing data.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UUUU">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843UUUU</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>In 2014, the US Department of Health and Human Services modified the perinatal HIV management guidelines suggesting that women are considered low risk if they are living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy &#x00028;ART&#x00029; with HIV RNA &#x0223C;1000 copies per mL in late pregnancy and near delivery. In this population, it no longer recommended to administer maternal intrapartum intravenous zidovudine. In addition, for low-risk HIV-exposed infants &#x00028;HEI&#x00029;, prophylaxis recommendation is 4 weeks of zidovudine after birth, whereas for high-risk HEI, it is 6 weeks of either a dual or triple therapy with zidovudine. This study was designed to help understand the use of these new perinatal HIV prevention interventions by evaluating the risk of perinatal HIV transmission in mother&#x02013;infant pairs in a high HIV prevalence US area.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, researchers included 551 HIV-exposed infants &#x00028;HEI&#x00029; and 542 mothers living with HIV in the Washington, District of Columbia, area who were evaluated at Special Immunology Services in Children&#x02019;s National Hospital between January 2013 and December 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>A retrospective cohort analysis of these mother&#x02013;infant pairs was completed, assessing a number of characteristics but, most notably, antiretroviral treatment during the pregnancy, HIV viral load at delivery, intrapartum zidovudine, delivery type &#x00028;cesarean delivery versus vaginal&#x00029;, antiretroviral prophylaxis regimen for infant, antiretroviral prophylaxis duration for infant, and final HIV status of infant.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The majority of mothers received antiretrovirals &#x00028;95.5&#x00025;&#x00029;, had HIV RNA &#x02264;1000 copies per mL before delivery &#x00028;81.9&#x00025;&#x00029;, and received intrapartum zidovudine &#x00028;zidovudine, 65.5&#x00025;&#x00029;. The majority of all HEIs were low risk &#x00028;82.6&#x00029;; among these low-risk HEIs, slightly over one-half were delivered via cesarean delivery, and 62.9&#x00025; received intrapartum zidovudine. In the study population, 9 infants acquired HIV perinatally and were all in the high-risk category, and not all of these infants were on dual or triple therapy with zidovudine.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In this study, the researchers highlighted that the newer perinatal HIV recommendations have not been completely adopted because they showed 62.9&#x00025; of the low-risk patients received intrapartum zidovudine, despite it no longer being recommended. Furthermore, of the 9 infants who acquired HIV perinatally, they were all considered high risk, but 6 were not on a dual or triple therapy. Certain factors can affect the decision to initiate combination antiretroviral therapy; however, in this study, it is suggested there were possible missed opportunities for use of this treatment as a prevention of perinatal HIV transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>As the field of HIV and perinatal treatment of mother&#x02013;infant pairs evolves and new recommendations emerge, it is essential the medical community strives to follow these recommendations as closely as possible to decrease perinatal HIV transmission. Adhering to the recommendations would minimize the medication exposures to those low-risk patients, while optimizing the antiretroviral regimen for high-risk HEIs, leading to the lowest perinatal HIV-transmission possible.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VVVV">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843VVVV</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Over 1 million women with HIV-1 become pregnant yearly. The use of antiretroviral therapy &#x00028;ART&#x00029; during pregnancy is important for the reduction of perinatal HIV transmission from mother to child and to improve maternal health outcomes. There is limited high quality data on the safety and effectiveness of ART with the use of dolutegravir. Dolutegravir was named a first-line therapy in adults with HIV by the World Health Organization in 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>This study is a phase 3, multicenter open-label randomized controlled study performed in pregnant women from 14 to 28 weeks&#x00027; gestation &#x00028;&#x02265;18 years of age&#x00029; in 9 countries &#x00028;including the United States, Brazil, South Africa, and India&#x00029;. Women with multiple fetuses, a known fetal anomaly, a known psychiatric illness in the mother, active tuberculosis in the mother, laboratory abnormalities &#x00028;a Cr clearance &lt;60 mL per minute or alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &#x02265;2.5 the upper limit or normal&#x00029; or &gt;14 days of ART during the current pregnancy were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Participants were split on the basis of gestational age &#x00028;14&#x02013;18 weeks, 19&#x02013;23 weeks, and 24&#x02013;28 weeks&#x00029; and were randomly assigned to receive either: &#x00028;1&#x00029; once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg &#x00028;integrase strand transfer inhibitors&#x00029; plus once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 25 mg &#x00028;nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]&#x00029;; &#x00028;2&#x00029; once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg plus once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg [NRTIs]; or &#x00028;3&#x00029; once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg &#x00028;non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs] or NRTIs&#x00029;. The primary end point was the proportion of viral suppression &#x00028;HIV-1 RNA concentration: &lt;200 copies per mL&#x00029; at or within 14 days of delivery. The primary safety outcomes included the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes &#x00028;preterm delivery, infant small for gestational age, stillbirth, or spontaneous abortion&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 617 pregnant women participated: 217 in group 1, 215 in group 2, and 211 in group 3. The median gestational age at enrollment was 21.9 weeks, and the median HIV-1 RNA copies were 902.5 copies/mL. At delivery, 98&#x00025; of the participants in groups 1 and 2 &#x00028;395 of 405&#x00029; had viral suppression, in comparison with 91&#x00025; &#x00028;182 of 200&#x00029; of the participants in group 3 &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .052; in intention-to-treat analysis&#x00029;. In terms of adverse pregnancy outcomes, there were significantly fewer participants with an adverse pregnancy outcome in group 1 &#x00028;52 of 216 [24&#x00025;]&#x00029; than there were in group 2 &#x00028;70 of 213 [33&#x00025;]&#x00029; or group 3 &#x00028;69 of 211 [33&#x00025;]&#x00029;. Children born to mothers in group 3 had higher rates of preterm delivery and neonatal mortality. Of note, however, there was no significant difference in grade &#x02265;3 adverse event outcomes in either mother or child between the 3 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The use of dolutegravir in adults including pregnant women as recommended by the World Health Organization is affirmed by this study. Additionally, the use of dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate may be favored to the regimen of dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate because of the lower incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes that was seen in this group.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Infection with HIV remains a global phenomenon and improving both maternal outcomes during pregnancy and reducing transmission of HIV from mother to child are essential. With this study conducted in many different countries, the authors provide evidence that ART started in pregnancy with dolutegravir induces viral suppression and is associated with better fetal outcomes.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WWWW">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843WWWW</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To determine the preliminary efficacy and durability of live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus RSV vaccine candidates from phase 1 clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Healthy RSV-na&#x000EF;ve children aged 6 to 24 months &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 241&#x00029; were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either a live-attenuated RSV vaccine or placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Separate trials of 7 different RSV vaccine candidates were similarly conducted, and data were pooled for analysis. The surveillance period was from &#x0223C;5.5 to 13 months after day 56 postvaccination. The RSV neutralizing antibody &#x00028;NeutAb&#x00029; response, also considered indicative of vaccine efficacy, was defined as more than a fourfold increase in complement-enhanced plaque reduction-neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination. Data were further grouped by &#x0201C;more promising&#x0201D; vaccines &#x00028;NeutAb response in &#x02265;80&#x00025; of vaccine recipients; <italic>n</italic> = 5&#x00029; and &#x0201C;less promising&#x0201D; &#x00028;NeutAb response in &#x02264;59&#x00025; of vaccines; <italic>n</italic> = 2&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There was 66&#x00025; efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus&#x02013;associated medically attended acute respiratory illness &#x00028;RSV-MAARI&#x00029; infections &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .007&#x00029; and 100&#x00025; efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus&#x02013;associated medically attended acute lower respiratory illness &#x00028;RSV-MAALRI&#x00029; &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .009&#x00029; among all NeutAb responders. A NeutAb response overall was significantly associated with protection against RSV-MAARI and RSV-MAALRI &#x00028;odds ratio: 0.26; 95&#x00025; confidence interval: 0.09 to 0.75; <italic>P</italic> = .014&#x00029;. Vaccine virus titers shed by vaccine recipients did not correlate with protection against RSV-MAARI or RSV-MAALRI. Although there was no significant difference in the primary NeutAb responses between the vaccinated and placebo groups &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .21&#x00029;, the magnitude of anamnestic NeutAb response was &#x0223C;10-fold higher in vaccine recipients than in those with the placebo after infection with wild-type RSV during surveillance &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> = .0001&#x00029;. In the vaccinated group not infected with wild-type RSV &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 89&#x00029;, the postsurveillance anamnestic NeutAb titers &#x00028;79 [6.3 log<sub>2</sub>]&#x00029; were less than postimmunization &#x00028;111 [6.8 log<sub>2</sub>]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;; however, the absolute difference was small. On the basis of the disease rate model, the authors determined that future study sample sizes between 540 and 1300 would be needed to demonstrate efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Live-attenuated RSV vaccines provide protection against acute respiratory and lower respiratory illnesses and can produce durable response.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Currently, palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is still the only Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;approved medication for RSV, providing short-term prophylaxis against severe RSV disease in high-risk infants and children with preexisting conditions, such as prematurity with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The preliminary data from these small clinical trials identifying these &#x0201C;more promising&#x0201D; vaccines suggest that we may be 1 step closer toward actually developing an RSV vaccine that can protect against infection and address the burden of RSV disease. Obvious considerations for future and later stage clinical trials include appropriately powered sample sizes &#x00028;including RSV-exposed subjects&#x00029;, study duration, geographic locations, timing of the RSV season, and vaccine delivery routes and dosing.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XXXX">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843XXXX</ext-link>

The person-to-person transmission of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses that are neurovirulent are primarily responsible for this emergence of these outbreaks; the World Health Organization has designated type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Two novel oral poliovirus vaccines &#x00028;OPVs&#x00029;, OPV2-c1 and OPV2-c2, were tested for safety and immunogenicity in infants and children. These 2 novel poliovirus vaccines had genetic modifications introduced to enhance the stability of the Sabin attenuations and reduce the risk of reversion to neurovirulence. A previous study in healthy adults was conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was a phase 2 study with low and high doses of 2 novel OPV2 candidates in Panama through a multicenter, partly masked randomized study. In the phase 2 study, children received 2 high doses of novel OPV2-c1 or novel OPV2-c2 28 days apart. Infants &#x00028;at 18&#x02013;22 weeks of age&#x00029; received 1 low dose or high dose of novel OPV2-c1 or novel OPV2-c2; randomly selected subsets &#x00028;<italic>n</italic> = 50&#x00029; of each group received a second dose 28 days later. Parents monitored and reported adverse events postvaccination. Type 2 poliovirus neutralizing antibodies were measured at days 0, 7, 28, and 56, and stool viral shedding was assessed up to 28 days postvaccination. The primary objective was the safety in all participants and noninferiority of the novel OPV2 day 28 seroprotection versus monovalent OPV2 in infants.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>In the novel OPV2 study, 47 children received the OPV2-c1 vaccine, and 53 received the OPV2-c2 vaccine as their first dose. A total of 97 of 100 children received a second dose; 45 children obtained the OPV2-c1 vaccine, and 52 received the novel OPV2-c2 vaccine. A total of 574 infants received the first dose of the novel OPV2 vaccine. A total of 36&#x00025; of children &#x00028;17 of 47&#x00029; after the OPV2-c1vaccine and 26&#x00025; of children &#x00028;14/53&#x00029; after the OPV2-c2 vaccine reported adverse events, consisting of loss of appetite, crying, fever, and irritability. There were 9 serious adverse events after OPV2-c1 and 13 after OPV2-c2 noted postvaccination &#x00028;mostly pneumonia or bronchiolitis; 1 death from severe pneumonia&#x00029;, but none were believed to be causally associated with the vaccine. Infants also experienced crying, irritability, fever, and vomiting. The authors reported no consistent pattern of laboratory abnormalities or changes in laboratory assessments in both infants and children. Evaluable seroconversion rates were 94&#x00025; to 100&#x00025; after 1 to 2 doses in the novel OPV2 groups. The low-dose and high dose OPV2-c1 and the high dose OPV2-c2 met noninferiority criterion. Almost all infants who received either high dose OPV2-c1 or OPV2-c2 had shedding of type 2 virus in stools at day 7.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The novel OPV 2 candidates appeared to be safe and immunogenic in children and infants in Panama. These candidates may represent a mechanism to decrease transmission of circulating neurovirulent type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In the study, the authors report both results with the novel OPV2 vaccine candidates and a baseline study with monovalent Sabin OPV2 before cessation of administration. Most doses were administered to infants who experienced mostly transient and mild adverse effects. Noninferiority criterion was met with the high dose and low-dose OPV2-c1 and high dose OPV2-c2 vaccines. These novel candidates potentially represent a mechanism for immunity against type 2 polioviruses and the OPV2-c1 vaccine was listed under the World Health Organization Emergency Use for use against type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks. With further larger studies, researchers will shed further light on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YYYY">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843YYYY</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>One of the harrowing aspects of the coronavirus disease 2019 &#x00028;COVID-19&#x00029; pandemic has been that many otherwise healthy individuals experienced severe disease after being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although clear risk factors for severe disease have been identified, including advanced age and a host of chronic illnesses, there have been many without any identifiable risks who have died or been severely affected. One hypothesis is that severe coronavirus disease &#x00028;COVID&#x00029; in otherwise healthy people represents a specific deficit in immune defense and or immune response. This could be interpreted as a severe COVID representing a primary immunodeficiency or, because now these diseases are also known, an inborn error of immunity &#x00028;IEI&#x00029;. The IEI term is increasingly preferred as opposed to primary immunodeficiency because not all genetic aberrancies of immunity result in a &#x0201C;deficiency.&#x0201D; To evaluate this hypothesis several international collaboratives of clinical investigators were formed and contributed to a recent report offering some initial findings.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this study, the researchers included 659 individuals with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and 534 individuals with asymptomatic or mild infection.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and whole exome or genome sequencing was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Most notably, IEI-affecting type-I interferon &#x00028;IFN&#x00029; were identified in 3.5&#x00025; of the severe COVID-19 cohort. The type-I IFN system, including both IFN-&#x003B1; and IFN-&#x003B2;, is part of the response arm of innate viral sensing. When produced, these proteins have the ability to induce many antiviral functions, including restraining cellular proliferation, inducing cellular antiviral programs and proteins, and activating natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Loss of function &#x00028;LOF&#x00029; variants in a number of genes in this pathway have been previously associated with severe influenza. LOF variants were identified in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance in 23 individuals with severe disease &#x00028;none of whom had been previously hospitalized for viral infection&#x00029;. The genes identified were <italic>TLR3, UNC93B1, TICAM1, TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, and IFNAR1/2</italic>. Although informatics can be used to identify damaging variants, in this study, all variants were evaluated in experimental in vitro systems to define the detrimental impact of variant identified on the type-I IFN system. Thus, each LOF variant found in a patient was proven to be damaging through what is known as functional genomics, revealing an irrefutable association between the variant and biological relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The initial hypothesis of the investigators regarding severe COVID-19 potentially representing the expression of an IEI, especially with regards to Type-I IFN in otherwise healthy individuals, was substantiated. Thus, through the exploration of individuals with severe COVID-19, the importance of type-I IFN in human defense against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been confirmed and underscored.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>In this work, the authors raise several important possibilities &#x00028;specifically, if type-I IFN gene pathway screens should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19 and if these individuals should be treated with type-I IFN&#x00029;. Importantly type-I IFN is a US Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;approved treatment of other conditions and, therefore, is available in therapeutically applicable formats for additional study applications. Furthermore, it is likely that the investigative team has discovered other variants of interest in their analyses. Specifically, ones that have not yet been associated with disease and may represent novel IEI, which will have been uncovered by severe COVID-19. These novel IEI will likely require further and more extensive work in functional genomics but should be anticipated.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZZZ">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843ZZZZ</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>In this study, researchers analyzed the CD4⁺ T-cell responses to spike peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 and 3 common cold coronaviruses &#x00028;CCCs&#x00029; before and after vaccination with Pfizer or Moderna messenger RNA &#x00028;mRNA&#x00029; coronavirus disease 2019 &#x00028;COVID-19&#x00029; vaccines to determine if the vaccine may be able to confer a T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 variants and some endemic CCCs.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Study participants included 30 healthy individuals who had not tested positive for COVID-19. They were vaccinated with either the Pfizer-BioNTech &#x00028;BN162b2&#x00029; or Moderna &#x00028;MrNA-1273&#x00029; mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Some experiments were performed on smaller numbers of subjects for whom sufficient numbers of cells were available.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Blood samples were studied to compare and quantify the frequency of virus-specific T cells before and after vaccination. Virus-specific T-cell responses to 3 CCCs &#x00028;human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63 &#x00028;HCoV-NL63&#x00029;, and human coronavirus OC43&#x00029; were compared before and after vaccination. In the study, the researchers also compared antigen-specific T-cell responses of spike peptides from HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, individual spike peptides targeted by CD4⁺ T cells were mapped and assayed so that distinct target peptides could be identified. The authors then determined if these spike peptide motifs were present in various coronaviruses, including 2 known COVID-19 variants: UK &#x00028;B.1.1.7&#x00029; and South African &#x00028;B.1.351&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The vaccines elicited a strong T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2, with a 74-fold increase in spot-forming units after vaccination. There was also an observed increase in T-cell response to HCoV-NL63, with a 3-fold increase in spot-forming units after vaccination. The results were similar when comparing the T-cell response to specific spike peptides of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 after vaccination: a 15-fold and 6.75-fold increase, respectively, in T cells coexpressing interferon &#x003B3; and tumor necrosis factor &#x003B1;. Finally, the authors mapped 23 distinct peptides targeted by CD4⁺ T cells, one of which was conserved in many coronaviruses, including the ancestral COVID-19 virus and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech &#x00028;BN162b2&#x00029; and Moderna &#x00028;MrNA-1273&#x00029; mRNA COVID-19 vaccines elicit strong T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines elicited a significant increase in the response to HCoV-NL63, a common cold coronavirus, as well. The data, overall, suggest that the mRNA vaccines may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 as well as some other common cold coronaviruses. The data also suggest that vaccine-elicited CD4⁺ T cells should recognize some of the widely circulating COVID-19 variants.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>With this study, the authors offer insight into the protection offered by the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, its variants, and possibly common cold coronaviruses. This is important for the general pediatrician to understand as more children become eligible for vaccination against COVID-19. Therefore, it may be reasonable to educate parents on the positive implications of vaccination against COVID-19 and how vaccination may confer crossprotection against some COVID-19 variants and some common cold viruses.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAAAA">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843AAAAA</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>An outbreak of Kawasaki disease was noted in 2020 in Italy during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 &#x00028;SARS-CoV-2&#x00029; pandemic. The authors&#x02019; objectives in which to evaluate the incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. They looked at cases of hemodynamic instability during the acute phase of the disease &#x00028;Kawasaki disease shock syndrome [KDSS]&#x00029; and those that might fulfill the criteria of macrophage activation syndrome &#x00028;MAS&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>All patients diagnosed with Kawasaki or Kawasaki-like disease who presented over the past 5 years &#x00028;January 1, 2015, and April 20, 2020&#x00029; before the COVID pandemic at this institution &#x00028;Bergamo, Italy&#x00029; were reviewed and compared with those who were diagnosed after the onset of the pandemic &#x00028;February 18 to April 20, 2020&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patients with Kawasaki-like presentations were defined according to the 2017 criteria of the American Heart Association, including both classic type and incomplete types. KDSS was defined as Kawasaki disease accompanied by systolic arterial hypotension, a decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure of at least 20&#x00025;, or the appearance of peripheral hypoperfusion. MAS was defined by using the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization criteria used in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and commonly used for other systemic autoinflammatory diseases &#x00028;Kawasaki disease and pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus&#x00029;. Data reviewed from medical records included demographic data, presenting symptoms and treatments, contact with confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019, vital signs, laboratory data &#x00028;white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, fibrinogen, pro B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, natural killer activity, and interleukin 6 concentrations&#x00029;, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram data. Current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 was obtained by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and by serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Patients were treated with 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin dosed on the basis of Kobayashi score with 2-week methylprednisolone taper.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Group 1 &#x00028;pre&#x02013;coronavirus disease&#x00029; comprised 19 patients &#x00028;7 boys and 12 girls; mean age: 3 years old&#x00029; and group 2 &#x00028;during coronavirus disease&#x00029; included 10 patients &#x00028;7 boys and 3 girls; mean age: 7.5 years old&#x00029;. A total 8 of 10 patients in group 2 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M or both. A total of 5 presented with classic Kawasaki, and 5 presented with incomplete form. Comparing the 2 groups &#x00028;group 1 versus group 2&#x00029;, there was a significant difference in disease incidence &#x00028;0.3 patients per month versus 10 patients per month&#x00029;, mean age &#x00028;3.0 vs 7.5 years&#x00029;, cardiac involvement &#x00028;2 of 19 vs 6 of 10&#x00029;, KDSS &#x00028;0 of 19 vs 5 of 10&#x00029;, MAS &#x00028;0 of 19 vs 5 of 10&#x00029;, and need for adjunctive steroid treatment &#x00028;3 of 19 vs 8 of 10; all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01&#x00029;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>A 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease was seen at this institution. Children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic onset showed evidence of an immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, had respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more resistant to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, had more severe disease, and had features of MAS.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>Within the past year, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has been diagnosed around the world. Some of these children will fulfill criteria for complete and incomplete Kawasaki. Affected children tend to be older, and there is disproportionate number of Hispanic and African American children. They present with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, conjunctivitis, mucous membrane involvement, neurocognitive symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and respiratory symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of this syndrome to ensure proper care of patients.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBBBB">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843BBBBB</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To summarize the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children &#x00028;MIS-C&#x00029; cases in 26 states.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>A total of 186 pediatric patients admitted to 38 sites in 26 states that were participating health centers in the Overcoming COVID-19 study and members of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Pediatric Intensive Care Influenza and Emerging Pathogens Subgroup. The case definition of MIS-C included 6 criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of &lt;21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 &#x00028;SARS-CoV-2&#x00029;, antibody testing, or exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Prospective and retrospective surveillance was used. Statistical analysis was performed to report the frequency of clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatments among patients stratified by SARS-CoV-2 test results, age, and clinical presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 186 patients were included on the basis of case definition. The median age was 8.3 years old, 62&#x00025; were male, and 73&#x00025; had previously been healthy. Overall, 70&#x00025; were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or antibody testing. The most common system involvement included the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematologic, mucocutaneous, and respiratory. In terms of clinical management, 80&#x00025; received intensive care, 20&#x00025; received mechanical ventilation, and 48&#x00025; received vasoactive support. Treatment included the use of intravenous immune globulin in 77&#x00025;, glucocorticoids in 49&#x00025;, and interleukin 6 or 1RA inhibitors in 20&#x00025;. Kawasaki disease&#x02013;like features were documented in 40&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>MIS-C affects previously healthy children and adolescents and includes multiple organ system involvement.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>The pathogenesis of MIS-C is still being investigated.

</p></sec><sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>Multisystem inflammatory disorder in children &#x00028;MIS-C&#x00029; is a recently identified rare disease process seen in some children after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 &#x00028;SARS-CoV-2&#x00029; infection. As a new disease entity, there have been efforts to clarify the diagnostic criteria for MIS-C to most accurately identify patients with this disease, while differentiating them from those with severe acute coronavirus disease 2019 &#x00028;COVID-19&#x00029;. In this study, the researchers aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children and adolescents with MIS-C and those with severe COVID-19 to better distinguish between these disease states.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>In this case series, 1116 patients were included who were &#x02264;21 years of age hospitalized between March and October 2020 from 66 hospitals across 31 states. A total of 539 of these patients had MIS-C, and 577 patients had severe acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for MIS-C was used in this study, which includes children &lt;21 years old, fevers &gt;38&#x000B0;C for &gt;24 hours, clinically severe illness of &#x02265;2 organs &#x00028;multisystem involvement&#x00029;, no other plausible diagnosis, and evidence of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or recent exposure. Severe acute COVID-19 was defined by clinical consensus criteria, including a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 and severe involvement of &#x02265;1 organ systems.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Patient surveillance data in the Overcoming COVID-19 network registry for hospitalized patients &lt;12 years old with MIS-C and severe acute COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Sex, race, ethnicity, comorbid conditions, presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory values within 48 hours of admission, severe complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups in the registry. Multivariable regression was used to compute adjusted risk ratios of factors associated with COVID-19 versus those associated with MIS-C.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Compared with patients with severe COVID-19, patients with MIS-C were more likely to be 6 to 12 years of age and of non-Hispanic Black race. Patients with MIS-C also had a higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, higher C-reactive protein, and lower platelet count, when compared with those with severe COVID-19. Clinical syndromes, including cardiorespiratory involvement, cardiovascular without respiratory involvement, and mucocutaneous without cardiorespiratory involvement, were more likely in the MIS-C group, compared with the severe COVID-19 group. Both groups had similar rates of severe respiratory involvement without cardiovascular involvement and death rates during hospitalization. In patients with MIS-C who received echocardiograms, 34&#x00025; of them had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction &#x00028;LVEF&#x00029;; however, 91&#x00025; had returned to a normal LVEF by 30 days, and 99&#x00025; of those evaluated had a normal LVEF by 90 days. A total of 13&#x00025; of patients with MIS-C who were evaluated for coronary aneurysms had aneurysms identified; 79&#x00025; of those aneurysms resolved by 30 days, and 100&#x00025; resolved by 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>There are patterns of clinical presentation in MIS-C and severe COVID-19 in a large cohort that can help differentiate these 2 disease processes and inform appropriate treatment. The cardiac involvement seen in MIS-C has a high likelihood of resolving over time.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS:</title><p>MIS-C and severe acute COVID-19 are currently understood to be discrete disease entities but often have overlapping clinical features, making it difficult to differentiate the 2 in some instances. Given that MIS-C is newly identified, in this study, the authors sought to clarify the defining features that discriminates between these 2 disease states. In this large case series, the authors were able to find differentiating factors including age, race, and clinical presentations. Mucocutaneous findings were more likely seen in MIS-C and may be a defining feature that is easy for the clinician to identify to support a diagnosis of MIS-C. Finally, laboratory values suggesting an inflammatory state such as elevated C-reactive protein and an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians differentiate MIS-C from severe COVID-19.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDDDD">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843DDDDD</ext-link>

<sec><title>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:</title><p>To identify specific symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory findings that are more indicative of patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children &#x00028;MIS-C&#x00029;, as opposed to other febrile illnesses.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY POPULATION:</title><p>Two cohorts of patients &#x02265;12 months were used in this study. Included in the first cohort were 44 patients who were diagnosed and treated for MIS-C at a large urban children&#x02019;s hospital in New York. Included in the second cohort were 181 patients who presented for evaluation of a febrile illness to a hospital-affiliated primary care pediatric clinic, 23 of whom were also evaluated in the emergency department.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was performed via a retrospective chart review. The inpatient cohort was selected from the New York City Department of Health&#x02019;s list of possible MIS-C cases from April 16 to June 10, 2020. Patients with MIS-C were defined as those who received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids in concordance with recommendations by rheumatology and infectious disease specialists. Patients whose cases were more consistent with Kawasaki disease as per American Heart Association 2017 guidelines and clinical judgement were excluded. Outpatient cases were selected by using a list of all patients who presented for an acute febrile illness during the same time period. Fever was defined as a temperature &#x02265;38&#x000B0;C, but, if not documented or if &lt;38&#x000B0;C, the fever height was recorded as &#x0201C;subjective.&#x0201D; Because most outpatients were evaluated via telehealth, laboratory testing was compared only between inpatients and patients evaluated in the emergency department. Demographics, laboratory values, physical examination findings, and symptoms were compared among the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Patients diagnosed with MIS-C, compared with those diagnosed with other febrile illnesses were found to exhibit the following: greater median age &#x00028;8.2 years versus 3.5 years; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, greater maximum temperature &#x00028;40.0&#x000B0;C vs 38.9&#x000B0;C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and longer duration of fever before presentation &#x00028;5 days versus 2 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;. Laboratory evaluation among patients with MIS-C versus those who presented to the ED for fever revealed more significant lymphopenia &#x00028;absolute lymphocyte count: 900 cells per &#x000B5;L [490&#x02013;1700] vs 2860 cells per &#x000B5;L [1900&#x02013;5400], respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, a greater neutrophil percentage &#x00028;80.5&#x00025; [71.6&#x02013;85.7] vs 40.1&#x00025; [19&#x02013;60]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001&#x00029;, and a lower initial platelet count &#x00028;179&#x02009;000 per &#x000B5;L [130&#x02009;000&#x02013;243&#x02009;000] vs 224&#x02009;000 per &#x000B5;L [195&#x02009;000&#x02013;308&#x02009;000]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;. Patients with MIS-C were also found to have statistically significant elevated levels of C-reactive protein &#x00028;164 mg/L [52&#x02013;250]&#x00029; and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide &#x00028;6700 pg/&#x000B5;L [2509&#x02013;25&#x02009;550]&#x00029;, but these values were only available in 14 inpatients and 9 outpatients. Clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, mucosal irritation, neck pain or stiffness, and rash, all correlated with MIS-C &#x00028;<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05&#x00029;</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In comparing patients with MIS-C to patients with other febrile illnesses, a particular set of symptoms, laboratory values, and physical findings were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>REVIEWER COMMENTS: </title><p>The diagnosis and management of MIS-C has evolved over the course of the pandemic, and the clinical presentation can be variable. With this study, the authors help to highlight clinical findings in patients with a diagnosis more consistent with MIS-C, as opposed to other febrile illnesses. When evaluating patients with fever, it is important to be aware of these possible MIS-C &#x0201C;red flags&#x0201D; but equally important to have a broad differential diagnosis. Appropriately diagnosing patients with MIS-C is imperative because current treatment recommendations include immunomodulation with corticosteroids and immunoglobulin. Such treatment may be undesirable in patients with overlap symptoms secondary to other systemic diseases &#x00028;ie, sepsis or malignancy&#x00029;.</p><p>URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EEEEE">www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2021053843EEEEE</ext-link>
